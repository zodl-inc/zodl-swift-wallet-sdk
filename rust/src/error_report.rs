//! Classification and redaction of errors that cross the FFI boundary.
//!
//! Two audiences read a failure and they need different things. The WALLET needs to branch on
//! the condition -- "still syncing", "not enough spendable funds" -- so it gets a stable
//! discriminant plus, where the condition is quantitative, the amounts as typed values. An
//! ERROR REPORT pasted into a support ticket needs a string carrying no amount, address, note
//! identifier or txid. `ClassifiedError::classify` serves both from one match.
//!
//! Every message returned here is a constant written in this file. None is `Display` output of
//! the error being classified. For the four generic payloads (`DataSource`, `CommitmentTree`,
//! `NoteSelection`, `Change`) that is enforced by the type system rather than by review:
//! `classify` places no `Display` or `Debug` bound on those parameters, so by parametricity it
//! has no way to render them. The concrete payloads (`NoteId`, `UnifiedAddress`,
//! `TransparentAddress`, `Zatoshis`) could be rendered and are withheld by choice.
//!
//! The unredacted text is not discarded: call sites log it at `debug!`, where it stays on the
//! device.
//!
//! `Display` on `ClassifiedError` is what `zcashlc_last_error_message` returns, so the legacy
//! one-string path is redacted for these call sites too, not only the new report path.
