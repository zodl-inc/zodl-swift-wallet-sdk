# Unreleased

# 4.0.0 - 2026-08-19

## Added
- The shielded voting surface (`VotingRustBackend`, the public `Voting*` types,
  `PirSnapshotResolver`/`PirSnapshotProbing`/`HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`, and the
  `zcashlc_voting_*` FFI) is restored on the Ironwood (NU6.3) stack, having been
  absent from 2.7.0-rc.1. The earlier removal recorded that `zcash_voting` could
  not resolve against the Ironwood `orchard` release; that was true of
  `zcash_voting 1.0.0`, which pins the pre-Ironwood librustzcash family, but not
  of `zcash_voting 2.0.0-rc.3`, which the SDK now builds against.

  The API differs from the one that shipped before 2.7.0-rc.1, because
  `zcash_voting` absorbed orchestration the SDK previously drove step by step.
  Wallet developers upgrading from a pre-2.7.0-rc.1 version must read
  MIGRATING.md; the most consequential change is that voting hotkeys are now
  app-owned random values rather than wallet-seed derivations, so the
  application must persist the hotkey's stored secret and cannot recover it from
  the seed phrase. Types carrying key material or note secrets (`VotingHotkey`,
  `VotingNoteInfo`, `VotingPczt`, `VotingDelegationKeyInputs`) now conform to
  `Undescribable` so their contents cannot leak through logging or reflection.

  The voting network is chosen once, when the database is opened, and every
  database-bound call takes it from there:
  `VotingRustBackend.open(path:networkId:)` gains the network, while
  `initRound(...)`, `commitVote(...)` and `precomputeDelegationPir(...)` no
  longer accept one and `VotingDelegationKeyInputs` no longer carries one. An
  unknown network id is rejected by `open` rather than by each later call, and a
  custom (regtest) network takes its voting identity from the registered base
  network — a modified-mainnet chain votes with mainnet hotkeys and address
  HRPs — so `open` fails if that network has not been configured yet.
- `MaxSpendMode`: describes how a "spend max" request should be evaluated,
  either targeting only currently-spendable funds (`maxSpendable`) or all
  non-dust funds in the wallet (`everything`, which excludes dust notes valued
  at or below the ZIP-317 marginal fee from selection and fails only if non-dust
  funds are unspendable or the wallet is unsynced).
- `Proposal.totalSpendValue()`: the total value a proposal spends across all
  of its steps, before its fee is deducted — each step's inputs minus its
  non-ephemeral proposed change. Ephemeral (ZIP-320) change is spent by a
  later step of the same proposal rather than retained by the wallet, so it
  is not deducted. Combined with the existing `totalFeeRequired()`, callers
  can derive the maximum amount a "spend max" proposal sends to its
  recipient as `totalSpendValue() - totalFeeRequired()`.

- Two thin passthroughs to `zcash_voting` operations the SDK previously made callers assemble by
  hand. `VotingRustBackend.confirmVoteSubmission(roundId:bundleIndex:proposalId:txHash:eventsJson:)`
  hands the chain's confirmation events to the crate, which parses them, records the transaction
  hash, advances the vote-authority-note position and records the vote-commitment tree position in
  one database transaction, returning both as `VotingVoteConfirmation` — replacing a caller-side
  `leaf_index` string split and a two-write window in which a crash could leave the two positions
  disagreeing. `VotingRustBackend.recoverWireJson(commitmentBundleJson:proposalId:shareIndex:voteCommitmentTreePosition:submitAt:)`
  rebuilds one helper-server payload from the persisted recovery bundle with the confirmed position
  late-bound into it, without re-proving or committing again; the returned string is the helper
  request body verbatim.

- `ZcashSDK.nu63ConsensusBranchID` publishes the NU6.3 ("Ironwood") consensus branch ID,
  `0x37a5_165b`. It was already used internally by the server-validation path; it is public now so
  hosts that must name the era — voting delegations are rejected outright when built for the wrong
  branch — take it from the SDK rather than copying the literal.

- `VotingRustBackend.signDelegationRequest(roundId:bundleIndex:keys:seed:)` lets a software
  wallet produce the SpendAuth signature a delegation submission needs. `zcash_voting 2.0` no
  longer derives account keys or signs for its callers, which left
  `getDelegationSubmission(roundId:bundleIndex:signature:sighash:)` reachable only by hardware
  signers; this is the crate's own prescribed software path — it loads the bundle's signing
  request, derives the account Orchard SpendAuth key from the wallet seed, randomizes it with
  the request's spend-auth randomizer and signs the stored ZIP-244 sighash, returning the
  detached signature and that sighash as `VotingDelegationSignature`. The seed is borrowed for
  the call and never persisted, logged or handed to `zcash_voting`; the signature is checked
  against the seed fingerprint the bundle was built for, so signing with the wrong seed fails
  instead of producing a rejected transaction. Software and hardware delegation now converge on
  the same submission entry point.

- `VotingRustBackend.recoverableShareIndices(commitmentBundleJson:)` lists the share indices a
  persisted vote recovery bundle can actually rebuild, via `zcash_voting::share::recover_payloads`'s
  own single-share slicing. Crash recovery previously guessed a share count from `singleShare`
  alone (`singleShare ? 1 : numOptions`), which under-delivers whenever the built share count
  differs from the option count — four of sixteen built shares on a four-option proposal, in the
  case that found this. The crate's recovered payloads are now the source of truth for which
  indices to resubmit.

## Changed

- Voting is pinned to `zcash_voting = "=3.0.0"` (exactly; a non-`=` requirement resolves to
  1.0.0). The 2.0 family made the PIR layout an explicit client/server handshake, so
  `VotingRustBackend.precomputeDelegationPir(...)` and `buildAndProveDelegation(...)` take a
  `pirLayout: VotingPirLayout` — the `pir_depth`/`tier0_layers`/`tier1_layers` triple from the
  round's resolved dynamic voting config. It defaults to `VotingPirLayout.unknown`, the crate's own
  `PirLayout::UNKNOWN` sentinel, which `zcash_voting` rejects: a caller that does not pass a
  resolved layout fails closed before any private query rather than querying with a guessed
  geometry.

  3.0 extends the handshake with the YPIR RLWE polynomial degree: `VotingPirLayout` gains a
  required `polyLen` (2048 or 4096), sourced from the dynamic config's `pir_layout.poly_len` and
  threaded through both wrappers, so PIR queries are built for the degree the server actually
  serves. The 2.0 family hardcoded 2048 and fails against 4096 datasets with opaque tier-1 query
  errors; 3.0 additionally verifies the advertised degree at connect and fails loudly on mismatch.
  `VotingPirLayout.unknown` (`polyLen` 0) still fails closed. Separately, `VoteShareWire` now
  carries `vote_round_id` (32 bytes, lowercase hex), so helper payloads from
  `recoverWireJson(...)` include it — wallets that injected the field into the request body can
  delete the injection.

- The voting FFI no longer maintains its own copies of `zcash_voting`'s wire formats. Payloads bound
  for the vote chain and the helper servers are serialized by the crate and handed across the
  boundary verbatim, which makes two rc.4 wire corrections automatic rather than hand-written:
  `VotingDelegationSubmission` gains `tx1Effects` (and loses the wire-level `sighash`), and helper
  payloads no longer carry every helper's share. Concretely: `VotingDelegationSubmission`'s byte
  fields are now base64 `String`s matching the crate's encoding; `VotingWireEncryptedShare`'s
  `ciphertext1`/`ciphertext2` are base64 `String`s; `VotingSharePayload` is removed; and
  `VotingVoteCommit` no longer carries `sharePayloads`, because payloads built before the vote's
  tree position is confirmed are provisional and must not be submitted.
- `Synchronizer` gained the required method `proposeSendMax(accountUUID:recipient:memo:mode:)` —
  plus matching `ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer` entries — with no default
  implementation: any external conformer or test double of these protocols must now implement it.
  It proposes a transaction that spends the maximum amount available in the account to a single
  recipient, using `MaxSpendMode` to control how much of the balance is targeted; no `amount` is
  passed, since the fee is already accounted for by the returned proposal. The proposal draws on
  shielded funds only (Sapling, Orchard, Ironwood) — transparent balance is never selected and must
  be shielded first (see `proposeShielding`). Sending a memo to a transparent recipient still throws
  `ZcashError.synchronizerSendMemoToTransparentAddress`, same as `proposeTransfer`. Failures surface
  as the existing `ZcashError.rustProposeSendMaxTransfer` (`ZRUST0129`).

## Fixed

- Voting delegation reads the **Ironwood** note-commitment tree, not the Orchard one. Voting notes
  live in the Ironwood pool and a round's `nc_root` is the Ironwood tree's root at the snapshot
  height, but `zcashlc_voting_generate_note_witnesses` decoded the Orchard tree out of the cached
  `TreeState`, validated that Orchard root against the round's Ironwood `nc_root`, and generated
  witnesses from the wallet's Orchard commitment tree; `VotingRustBackend.extractNcRoot(treeState:)`
  computed the Orchard root too. The two pools are tracked separately and their roots never
  coincide, so every delegation failed with `cached TreeState orchard root does not match round
  nc_root` — on every chain, against every server, for every round. Witness generation now goes
  through `zcash_voting`'s own Ironwood-aware path, which additionally rejects a wallet database
  whose network differs from the round's and a snapshot height that is not NU6.3, and `extractNcRoot`
  returns the Ironwood root. Two regression tests seed a `TreeState` carrying *both* pools and
  assert the Ironwood one wins, so the wrong-pool read cannot return unnoticed.
- `proposeTransfer` and `proposeSendMax` now throw
  `ZcashError.synchronizerSendMemoToTransparentAddress` when a memo accompanies a
  TEX recipient, matching the existing behavior for transparent recipients.
  Previously a memo aimed at a TEX address reached the rust backend and failed
  with a generic `ZcashError.rust*` error instead.

# 3.0.0 - 2026-08-19

## Added

### Custom (regtest-style) networks

- `NetworkActivationHeights` (per-upgrade heights `sapling` through `nu6_3`, plus
  `.allActiveFromGenesis`), `ZcashNetworkBuilder.regtest(activationHeights:)`,
  `ZcashNetworkBuilder.custom(base:activationHeights:)`, and `ZcashSDKRegtestConstants`.
- `ZcashNetwork.saplingActivationHeight`, `.customActivationHeights`, and `.customNetworkBase`.
  Default implementations keep existing `ZcashNetwork` conformers source-compatible.
- A custom network skips the chain-name and consensus-branch-id server checks, in sync validation and
  in `evaluateBestOf(endpoints:)`; the Sapling-activation-height check still applies. Registration is
  process-global and ordering-sensitive — see `MIGRATING.md`.

### Transaction submission

- `timing`-less overloads of `Broadcaster.submit(transaction:to:)` and
  `Broadcaster.submit(transactions:to:)`, defaulting to `SubmissionTiming.default`.

### Balances

- `PoolBalance.lockedValue`: value held by an output lock, excluded from `spendableValue` but still
  owned by the account.
- `AccountBalance.shieldedSpendableValue`, `.shieldedTotal()`, `.shieldedChangePendingConfirmation`,
  and `.shieldedValuePendingSpendability`: sums over every shielded pool, so call sites need not
  hand-sum pools and pick up future pools automatically.

### Ironwood pool

- `ZcashTransaction.Output.Pool.ironwood`: Ironwood outputs decode to their own case instead of
  `.other(4)`. A `switch` over `Pool` with no `default` stops compiling until the case is handled.
- `ZcashNetwork.ironwoodActivationHeight`.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.zip318Kind` reports how a transaction classifies against ZIP 318:
  `nonconforming`, `preparation`, `transfer`, `canonicalCrossingPayment`, or `notClassified`. It is a
  conformance class, not a provenance — only `preparation` and `transfer` name a migration this
  account made. `notClassified` is the absence of a decision rather than a negative one: the
  transaction predates the underlying column, has not been decrypted yet, or carries an encoding this
  SDK does not know. Rescan before reading anything into it.

### Orchard → Ironwood migration

`MIGRATING.md` carries the driver shape, before/after code, and the case-by-case replacement mapping.

- A migration group on the `Synchronizer` protocol, account-scoped by `AccountUUID`. Two accounts
  (for example one software and one hardware-wallet account) can migrate concurrently. Its members
  work without `prepare()`, so a background session can deliver a transfer without starting sync, and
  on custom networks without a prior `Initializer`. `ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer` do
  not mirror the group.
- Value types: `MigrationAdvance`, `MigrationAdvanceStep`, `MigrationNextWork`, `MigrationStepKind`,
  `MigrationBroadcastInstruction`, `MigrationProveTarget`, `MigrationProveOutcome`,
  `MigrationProgress`, `MigrationSchedule`, `MigrationTransferProposal`, `MigrationTransferResult`,
  `MigrationRunEstimate` (with `MigrationRunEstimate.Run`), `MigrationSyncWakeup`,
  `MigrationPreparationStep`, `MigrationSigningBudget`, `NoteSplitProposal`,
  `PreparedMigrationTransfer`, `MigrationUnsignedTransferPczt`, `MigrationSignedTransferPczt`,
  `MigrationTransactionStatus`, `KeystoneBatchDecodeResult`, and `KeystoneFirmwareVersion`. Migration
  transaction ids are `UInt32`.
- `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` is the drive: `nil` when no run is stored, otherwise a
  `MigrationAdvance` whose `.step` is `.prove(transactions:)`, `.broadcast(_:)`, `.rebuild(id:)`,
  `.replan`, `.reevaluate`, `.waiting`, or the terminal `.complete`. `.replan` and `.reevaluate` name
  no transaction: the first asks for a new plan, the second only for a sync. `.complete` is terminal
  per run, including a cancelled one — ask `proposeMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` whether anything
  remains to migrate.
- `MigrationAdvance.next` carries the advisory outlook: a `MigrationNextWork` naming the kind of the
  migration's next serviceable work and the earliest height it becomes serviceable at, or `nil` when
  nothing is height-schedulable. A `.broadcast` outlook needs no sync session; a `.prove` one is
  sync-bound. It is a floor, not an appointment, and the next crank supersedes it.
- A `.prove` step carries the whole provable set (`[MigrationProveTarget]`, earliest-ready first,
  never empty), and that batch is the instruction the prove executor takes. Each `MigrationProveTarget`
  carries `isScheduleDue`: `true` means the schedule has already reached that transaction's broadcast
  window, so its missing proof is what blocks delivery now.
- Hand each actionable arm's own payload to its executor: `.prove` to
  `proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)`, `.broadcast` to
  `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)`, `.rebuild` to
  `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)`. `maxProofs` (at least `1`; skips do not spend it)
  bounds a background session's proving CPU. `performMigrationBroadcast` returns the recorded
  `MigrationTransferResult` directly. A stale instruction throws
  `rustMigrationTakeBroadcastTransaction` — discharge it by cranking again, not by retrying the
  executor.
- `MigrationBroadcastInstruction` and `MigrationProveTarget` have no public initializers, so
  un-instructed proving or broadcasting does not compile. Both initializers are
  `@_spi(Testing) public`, so a suite that writes `@_spi(Testing) import ZcashLightClientKit` can
  construct genuine instructions to exercise its driver. This is a Swift-surface property, not a
  security boundary.
- A proved preparation is submitted by the app through its ordinary raw-transaction path.
  `proveMigrationTransactions` returns a `MigrationProveOutcome` — the total proved plus the txids of
  the preparations it proved — and `takeMigrationPreparation(accountUUID:byTxid:)` hands each back as
  a `PreparedMigrationTransfer`. Retrieve at submission time: the wallet's record binds at retrieval,
  and a consumer that crashed before submitting re-retrieves the same bytes over the same record.
  Close the loop on acceptance with `recordMigrationPreparationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:result:)`; a
  non-acceptance needs no call. Both members are preparation-gated — a transfer's txid is refused,
  because transfers are served by the broadcast instruction alone.
- `nextMigrationWake(accountUUID:)`: the outlook retained from the most recent
  `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` crank by any caller, so a host can arm OS wake-ups without
  re-cranking. Same advisory-floor contract as `MigrationAdvance.next`, superseded unconditionally by
  the next crank — including to `nil`, which also means no crank has run yet this session. It
  complements `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)` rather than replacing it: one height against the
  schedule's many, so min-fold the two when arming wake-ups.
- `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)`: the stored run's minimal sync/proving wake-up schedule — the
  heights to wake, sync and crank at, plus the transfer ids each wake-up covers.
- `estimatedMigrationChainTip()` and `estimatedMigrationSecondsPerBlock()`: a measured-block-rate
  wall-clock chain-tip projection. Both are wallet-scoped and take no account.
  `hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` gains a `useEstimatedTip: Bool` parameter (a
  one-argument convenience overload defaults it to `false`) that lets the estimated tip only
  accelerate scheduled-height due-ness; expiry always evaluates against the scanned tip, and an
  estimator failure degrades to scanned-tip behavior. `migrationAdvanceStep` applies the same rule
  with no parameter at all — it always projects the estimate.
- Planning and delivery: a randomized-cadence schedule from `proposeMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)`,
  committed by `signAndStoreMigrationSchedule`, proved opportunistically during sync by
  `proveMigrationTransactions` at the wake-ups above, then delivered by `performMigrationBroadcast` in
  a session that does not sync. Proving a batch can unblock rows it did not name, so a driver draining
  a run cranks again after each pass. Broadcast never proves: a due row still awaiting its proof
  appears in the `.prove` batch with `isScheduleDue` set rather than as a delivery outcome. A submit
  rejection identifying the transaction as already known is recorded as success, so a retried
  broadcast whose first attempt landed completes the transfer. There is no repair member — every
  repair happens inside `migrationAdvanceStep`, and mined-ness is derived at the wallet's
  fully-scanned height, never reported.
- Recovery: `restartCurrentMigrationStep` cancels and re-plans;
  `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` rebuilds every expired transfer of the stored run,
  all-or-nothing, with `usk` selecting in-process signing or the external-signer lane. A funding note
  spent outside the migration throws, naming `restartCurrentMigrationStep` as the remedy.
- Note split: `submitNoteSplit(accountUUID:proposal:usk:options:)` signs the run, serves the first
  note-split transaction back through the same atomic broadcast seam the delivery step uses, and
  submits it — what it broadcasts is a finalized consensus transaction, with no extract step in
  between.
- External signer: `createUnsignedNoteSplitPCZTs` / `storeSignedNoteSplitPCZTs` and
  `createUnsignedMigrationTransferPCZTs` / `storeSignedMigrationSchedulePCZTs`. All are plural: a run
  has N preparation transactions, and one signing ceremony covers them together.
- Keystone batch signing: `buildKeystoneSignBatchQRParts(requestId:pczts:maxFragmentLen:)`,
  `resetKeystoneSignBatchDecoder()`, `decodeKeystoneSignBatchPart(_:expectedRequestId:)`, and
  `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:)`. Retain your own unredacted PCZTs and pass
  them back in the same order — signatures align by position. A completed scan is the only place the
  device's `KeystoneFirmwareVersion` is reported; a request-id mismatch throws.
  `batchMigrationPcztsForSigning(_:maxActionsPerSession:)` splits an ordered unsigned-PCZT batch into
  signer sessions bounded by an action budget (`MigrationSigningBudget.keystone` is 96, `.default`
  512), preserving order, for dispatching each session through the QR ceremony on its own.
- Residual and estimation: `lockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:)` locks every spendable legacy-Orchard
  note until explicit unlock and returns the total locked; `unlockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:)`
  returns the number of locks cleared; and `estimateMigrationRuns(accountUUID:)` returns the
  `MigrationRunEstimate` behind a multi-round UI. Locked notes are excluded from selection, so
  migrating a locked residual anyway means `unlockMigrationResidual` then `proposeImmediateMigration`,
  in that order. Each `MigrationRunEstimate.Run` carries `actions` (the signing workload in
  Orchard-family actions) and `keystoneSigningSessions`, summed across runs as `totalActions` and
  `totalKeystoneSigningSessions`.
- `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)`: the live per-transaction rows behind
  `migrationProgress`'s summary — kind, lifecycle state, scheduled and expiry heights, readiness, next
  action/blocker, `dependsOn` (the ids of the same run's transactions that must mine first), and
  `anchorBoundaryHeight` (the boundary a transfer's anchor was drawn against; always `nil` for a
  preparation), keyed by a stable id. Input-spend and inherited marks project onto
  `.invalid(reason: .fundingSpent)`, other unsatisfiable causes and an awaiting reevaluation onto
  `.rejectedInvalid`; new expiry decisions use `Blocker.expired`, with `.rejectedExpired` kept
  source-compatible. Chain inclusion outranks both. An empty array means no stored run, not an error.
  `Array<MigrationTransactionStatus>.isPreparationPhaseComplete` is `true` iff every preparation-kind
  row is mined (vacuously `true` when the run needs no preparations).
- Privacy and cost contract to build confirmation UI around: broadcasts go over a dedicated Tor
  runtime, independent of the global `tor(enabled:)` toggle, and fail closed — Tor requested but
  unavailable throws `ZcashError.migrationTorUnavailable`, never a silent clearnet fallback.
  `MigrationNetworkPrivacyOptions.submissionEndpoint` is required: exactly one server per attempt,
  chosen by the host, and confirmation comes from block scanning rather than txid polling. The
  broadcasting members throw `ZcashError.migrationBroadcastDuringSync` while a sync runs, and a record
  failure after a successful broadcast throws the distinguishable
  `ZcashError.migrationRecordFailedAfterBroadcast`, which a later execution window heals.
- Persisting the committed schedule is the host's responsibility; the SDK keeps no copy.
  `MigrationSchedule` gains `preparations: [MigrationPreparationStep]` — the note-preparation
  transactions of the same plan the transfer rows alone do not surface — decoded as an empty array
  from a copy persisted before the field existed. Its `encode(to:)` omits `proposalHandle`, so every
  decoded copy carries handle `0`: re-propose instead of committing a persisted schedule.
- New `ZcashError` cases: `ZRUST0099`–`ZRUST0106`, `ZRUST0108`, `ZRUST0111`–`ZRUST0113`,
  `ZRUST0115`–`ZRUST0122`, `ZRUST0124`–`ZRUST0138`, `ZRUST0140`–`ZRUST0147`, and `ZRUST0149`. Every
  gap in those ranges is a code retired before release with the member it served, and none is reused.

### Slipstream sync engine

- `SlipstreamSynchronizer`, an alternative `Synchronizer` implementation with non-linear
  Spend-before-Sync scheduling, concurrent density-adaptive fetch, per-call Tor policy with server
  failover, and a stall watchdog. Hosts opt in by constructing it; `SDKSynchronizer` remains the
  default. It implements the migration group above with the same session separation. Error codes
  `ZRUST0093`–`ZRUST0097`.
- `SynchronizerState.isRecovering`.
- `Proposal.spendsLegacyOrchardFunds` — whether the proposal spends notes from the legacy Orchard
  pool, so wallets can warn before a turnstile-crossing send.
  `Proposal.testOnlyFakeProposal(totalFee:spendsLegacyOrchardFunds:)` gained a defaulted parameter for
  building test fixtures.

## Changed

- The SDK is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 only (AGPL-3.0-only)
  instead of the MIT License. An application that incorporates it must make the complete corresponding
  source of that application available under the AGPL to its users, including users who interact with
  it over a network, and no permission is granted to distribute such an application through the Apple
  App Store or any other channel whose terms are incompatible with the AGPL. A commercial license is
  available for applications that cannot meet those conditions; see `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`, and
  `LICENSE-EXCEPTIONS.md` for App Store distribution and trademark use.
- `Synchronizer.allTransactions()` is now a protocol requirement, and
  `TransactionRepository.unreconciledTxids()` exposes the read-side reconciliation view, defaulting to
  empty where the engine's view is absent. Any conformer or test double must provide them.
- `Synchronizer.migrationPrivacySyncBufferDuration` is removed, along with its protocol-extension
  default: any reference stops compiling, and there is nothing to replace it with. The migration sync
  gate is now behavior-based and imposes exactly one hold — `start(retry:)` throws
  `ZcashError.migrationSyncBlocked` only while a migration submission is in flight, the seconds
  between the transaction reaching the network and its outcome being recorded. Nothing else holds
  sync, and user intent that requires sync must never be deferred for this. A host that scheduled work
  around the buffer should stop. See `isMigrationSyncBlocked()` and `migrationSyncBlockedStream`. Gate
  files persisted by an earlier build load unchanged.
- `restartCurrentMigrationStep` records the abandoned run with the terminal `Cancelled` status
  (previously `Failed`, which left a deliberate abandonment indistinguishable from a broken run) and
  releases every note reservation its never-broadcast transactions held, so the fresh plan the restart
  previews sees the full balance immediately.
- `migrationTransactionStatuses`, `migrationProgress`, `hasOverdueMigrationTransfers`,
  `hasInvalidMigrationTransfers` and `migrationSyncWakeups` no longer take the database write actor,
  so they answer in milliseconds even while a proof is being generated. A just-mined broadcast can
  trail in these answers by at most one write-lane pass — typically the next sync edge or UI refresh.
  Checkmark and "done" rendering is unaffected, deriving from the wallet's own mined transactions.
- Read-only calls — wallet getters, balances, memos, the `propose*` family — no longer queue behind
  writes, so they answer while a proof is being generated. Write-bearing calls, including each proof
  chunk, remain serialized against one another.
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.7`,
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.7`, `zcash_protocol 0.10.4` and `pczt 0.9.2`, which are the source of
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview.zip318Kind` and of the `createTransactionFromPCZT` Ironwood-output fix.
  The family rides an interim git revision until the migration-engine work it depends on is published.

## Fixed

- `getAllTransactions` no longer fails on wallets whose `trust_status` column is NULL — which is every
  wallet today, since transaction trust (`set_tx_trust`) is an opt-in marker with no default and no
  backfill. The strict `Overview` decode threw on the first row, rendering an empty transaction list
  over a fully-populated wallet. A NULL now decodes as untrusted.
- `SimpleConnectionProvider`'s lazy connection init is lock-guarded: two concurrent first-touch reads
  could construct two SQLite connections, silently dropping one and its serial queue with it.
- The Slipstream stall watchdog no longer fires on a restarted engine's inherited history. The
  evaluated span is clamped to the current handle's own lifetime, so time accumulated before — and
  across — a deliberate stop no longer trips the hung-engine log at the moment recovery is working.
- The migration sync gate's blocked stream now wakes at the in-flight marker's own expiry rather than
  only on a flat 15-second ticker, closing a gap of up to a whole interval between a cleared gate and
  resumed sync. With no boundary pending it keeps the flat cadence.
- Proved migration transactions are recorded in the wallet's own transaction tables at proving time,
  so their inputs are marked spent from the moment the proof exists and the wallet's own sends can no
  longer double-spend a scheduled transfer's inputs during the window between proving and broadcast.
- Anchor-retention marks are persisted into the wallet database at wallet open. Retained only in
  memory, they left the database's retained-checkpoint tables empty, so its open-time deep-history
  heal eventually pruned migration boundary anchors once they aged past its margin — permanently
  stalling any migration whose privacy schedule runs longer than that (~3.5 days on testnet, ~8.7 on
  mainnet). Every policy-retained height from NU6.3 activation to the chain tip is now marked durable
  in all three pools before the first session of the app-open.
- A migration transfer whose funding preparation mined later than the anchor boundary drawn for it at
  commit time no longer stalls the migration forever, reported ready to prove, blocked on nothing, and
  proving nothing. The boundary is re-validated against the funding preparations' real mined heights at
  proving time and re-drawn from the note's actual creation height when it postdates the drawn one. A
  wedged run needs no restore: the next sweep re-draws, proves, and the run completes.
- The migration prove sweep no longer freezes interactive reads for its whole duration: proofs are
  produced one per database-actor turn, so screens that read the wallet database wait at most one
  proof instead of the entire sweep. Proving worker threads run at utility QoS on Apple platforms.
- `createTransactionFromPCZT(pcztWithProofs:pcztWithSigs:)` now records the transaction's Ironwood
  outputs. Every Ironwood output was previously omitted, so for a post-NU6.3 PCZT that delivers its
  payment through the Ironwood pool the recipient address and the memo the wallet sent were never
  persisted — and are not recoverable afterwards — while wallet-internal Ironwood outputs stayed
  absent from `getTransactionOutputs(for:)` until the transaction was mined and scanned. Shielded
  outputs stored by this path are now tagged with their note commitment tree, as the ordinary send
  path already did.
- Transactions created from both ordinary proposals and finalized PCZTs are now returned for
  broadcast from the wallet store instead of being reconstructed from `v_transactions`. If that
  history view has not projected the stored row yet, sends and transparent-fund shielding continue
  to submission instead of failing with `ZTREE0001 transactionRepositoryEntityNotFound`.
  Creation-time history events contain every overview currently available and omit only the missing
  entries; failure to read required wallet-store bytes reports `ZRUST0150 rustGetTransaction` with
  the affected transaction id and any ids already read.
- `SlipstreamSynchronizer.wipe()` now deletes the submit-plan database file, as
  `SDKSynchronizer.wipe()` already did. A wallet wiped through the Slipstream synchronizer left
  `submit_plans_<networkId>.db` behind, along with the retry plans it held for transactions the
  wipe had just erased.
- Background transaction resubmission now runs under `SlipstreamSynchronizer` too, matching
  `SDKSynchronizer`: unmined, unexpired transactions are periodically re-broadcast through their
  recorded submit plans, and plans whose transactions have expired are pruned. A transaction that
  never reached the network — submitted while the server was unreachable, or dropped from every
  mempool it was sent to — previously got no second chance on this synchronizer. The check runs at
  most once a minute while the engine is syncing or synced, and the re-broadcast itself is
  throttled as before.

# 2.8.0-rc.3 - 2026-07-29

## Changed

- `NetworkType` gained a `.regtest` case: an exhaustive `switch` over it stops compiling until the
  case is handled.
- `prepare(with:walletBirthday:name:keySource:)` no longer takes a `WalletInitMode`, and that enum is
  removed — the SDK derives new-versus-restore from the wallet state and the now-optional birthday.
  Drop the argument; see `MIGRATING.md`.
- `PoolBalance.total()` now includes `lockedValue`, so locked funds stay visible in account sums.
- `proposeImmediateMigration(accountUUID:)` returns an `ImmediateMigrationProposal` (a `Proposal`
  plus its decoded `amount` and `fee`) instead of a `MigrationSchedule`, and executes through the
  ordinary `createProposedTransactions` / `createPCZTFromProposal` pipeline. Record the broadcast with
  the new `recordImmediateMigration(accountUUID:txid:)` so `migrationProgress(accountUUID:)` reports
  it. See `MIGRATING.md`.
- Once an immediate sweep recorded that way mines, `migrationProgress(accountUUID:)` reports `nil`
  again rather than a terminal snapshot: there is nothing for the user to acknowledge, and a
  balance-gated prompt re-offers only if new Orchard funds arrive. `MigrationProgress.isImmediate`
  distinguishes an in-progress immediate sweep from an engine-tracked run; its initializer defaults
  the field, so existing construction still compiles. The immediate lane never creates an
  engine-tracked run, so `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` stays `nil` throughout — the two
  surfaces are orthogonal.
- The SDK-side migration state machine (`MigrationState`, `MigrationAttentionReason`,
  `migrationState(accountUUID:)`) is removed before any release shipped it, replaced by the
  verbatim `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` conduit above. See `MIGRATING.md` for the full
  case-by-case replacement mapping.
- `proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration(accountUUID:)` remains for existing callers, but it sweeps only
  what fits in one transaction and cannot migrate a realistic Orchard balance; new integrations
  should drive the migration group above.
- The wallet database opens with a 15 s SQLite `busy_timeout`, so contention with a concurrent writer
  surfaces as a wait rather than an immediate `database is locked`.
- Updated the librustzcash crates to `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.6` and
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.6`, adopting the revised ZIP 318 migration timing
  (shorter transfer and preparation delays, and an anchor-age cap of 4 bucket
  boundaries rather than 16).
- A canonical ZIP 318 crossing is now funded from the single oldest Orchard note
  that covers the payment and its fee, falling back to ordinary multi-note funding
  when no such note exists. Canonical-denomination payments that previously lost
  the canonical shape to multi-note funding now take it whenever a single covering
  note exists.

## Fixed

- `ZcashRustBackend.decryptAndStoreTransaction` misread the FFI's -1 error sentinel as success (the
  FFI returns 1 on success and -1 on error, never 0, so the `result != 0` guard could not fire). A
  failed decrypt-and-store now throws `ZcashError.rustDecryptAndStoreTransaction` with the
  underlying Rust error instead of silently returning an all-zero txid — previously such failures
  were treated as completed work by transaction enhancement, the mempool monitor, and
  `enhanceTransactionBy`, hiding missing transaction data (memos, transparent history) without any
  error or retry.
- The witnesses-fix gate compared the recorded and current app versions with a plain String
  comparison, which orders versions lexicographically: whenever the shorter number's leading digit
  was the larger one (for example 2.9.0 → 2.10.0, 2.4.9 → 2.4.10, or 2.99.0 → 2.100.0) the upgrade
  read as a downgrade and silently skipped the note-commitment-witness repair check — and kept
  skipping it until some later version sorted above the stale recorded string. Versions are now
  compared numerically component-wise (missing components count as zero), and versions that cannot
  be ordered numerically run the check rather than risk missing a repair.
- The witnesses-fix gate recorded its "already repaired" marker under a single app-wide key.
  Because every synchronizer alias owns a separate data DB, only the first alias to call `prepare()`
  was ever repaired for a given app version; the other wallets' databases were never checked. The
  marker is now scoped per alias. Existing installs have no marker under the new key, so the repair
  check runs once more on the next launch.
- The witnesses-fix gate wrote its marker before running the repair, so a launch interrupted
  part-way through recorded a repair that never completed. The marker is now written afterwards.
- The witnesses-fix gate treated a host that reports no `CFBundleShortVersionString` as if it were
  running version `""`. After the first launch that gate could never re-open, and an unreadable
  version would overwrite a previously recorded real one. A missing version is now treated as
  unknown: the repair runs and no marker is recorded.
- The witnesses-fix marker was only ever moved forward, so a single higher version — a beta the
  user later rolled back from — suppressed the repair for every release below it. The marker now
  tracks the version that is actually running.
- The witnesses-fix gate now logs which version it decided for and why, so a skipped repair leaves
  a trace.
- Memos on Ironwood outputs are retrievable; a note id in the Ironwood pool was rejected as an
  unrecognized shielded protocol.
- `getAccountsBalances()` no longer reports empty balances for up to ~30 s after a restore completes,
  which briefly zeroed the restored funds and any migration eligibility derived from them.
- Under `SlipstreamSynchronizer`, the collapsed balance reported during a restore lands in the
  Ironwood pool once NU6.3 is active rather than in Orchard, so a host gating a migration prompt on a
  nonzero Orchard balance is no longer prompted on a guess. Totals are unchanged.
- `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:)` accepts a batch whose PCZT ids are not
  engine-numeric; it previously failed after an otherwise successful device scan.
- A malformed or hostile lightwalletd subtree-roots response no longer crashes the process on an
  out-of-range `completingBlockHeight`.
- A stalled Ironwood subtree-roots stream is retried like the Sapling and Orchard streams instead of
  adding the full streaming deadline to every sync pass. Genuine "Ironwood not supported" responses
  are still skipped.
- A wallet whose database was upgraded by a build using
  `zcash_client_sqlite 0.22.0-rc.1` (the 2.6.6 internal build) no longer fails
  every scan. Such a wallet's `orchard_ironwood_migrations` table never acquired
  the `anchor_bucket_interval` column, added to the table-creation migration in
  place afterwards, and the column reference then failed on every scan — no block
  could be written and no transaction ever acquired a mined height, whether or not
  a pool migration was in progress. A new database migration adds the missing
  column. The backfilled value is exact on the production network; on a test
  network, a pool migration planned under a custom anchor grid is reported as
  `AnchorIntervalMismatch` and must be re-planned.
- A ZIP 318 crossing anchored to a bucket boundary whose block contains no note
  commitments in any pool no longer fails with `ProposalError::AnchorNotFound`:
  scanning now creates a checkpoint at every anchor-retention grid height, and
  proposal creation additionally falls back to an ordinary crossing when no anchor
  is computable at the boundary rather than proposing a build that would fail.
- Note selection now draws the oldest eligible notes first, in note commitment
  tree (chain) order. Notes were previously drawn in scan-discovery order, which
  for a restored wallet prefers its most recently discovered — typically newest —
  notes.
- A payment to one of the wallet's own transparent addresses is now reported with
  the transparent receiver address itself as the output's recipient, rather than
  the receiving account's unified address; for outputs the wallet created, the
  recipient address recorded at transaction construction time takes precedence
  over the receiving address.

# 2.8.0-rc.2 - 2026-07-28

## Changed
- `proposeTransfer` and `proposefulfillingPaymentURI`: once NU6.3 is active, a single payment whose
  value is a canonical ZIP 318 denomination (a `{1, 2, 5} * 10^k` amount from 0.01 to 10,000 ZEC)
  crossing the Orchard turnstile is proposed as a canonical crossing. Such a proposal pays one fewer
  ZIP 317 marginal-fee action, and requires up to two anchor-bucket intervals of confirmations on its
  inputs beyond the `ConfirmationsPolicy` you passed. No call-site change: a payment the wallet
  cannot fund that way is proposed as an ordinary transaction, as before.

## Fixed
- An Ironwood note received on an account's internal address is reported as change.
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview.hasChange` was `false` while the note was counted in `receivedNoteCount`
  and `sentNoteCount`, and `ZcashTransaction.Output.isChange` presented the account's own change as a
  recipient of the user's transaction. Balances were unaffected. Existing rows are repaired on
  upgrade; no rescan is required.
- An address that had received only Ironwood notes counted as unused, so
  `getCustomUnifiedAddress(accountUUID:receivers:)` could hand it out again and the receiving account
  was not reported as involved in the transaction that paid it. Since NU6.3 delivers every payment to
  an Orchard receiver in the Ironwood bundle, this affected ordinary receives. Repaired on upgrade.
- `getTransactionOutputs(for:)` omitted the transparent outputs of a transaction funded entirely from
  the Ironwood pool, and could attribute an output funded from several pools to an account other than
  the largest contributor.
- A sent transaction whose shielded spends and outputs this wallet cannot observe — one funded
  entirely by transparent inputs whose shielded outputs belong to another wallet — now has its mined
  or expired status resolved during enhancement.
- Calls routed over Tor time out instead of hanging indefinitely against a server that accepts a
  connection and then never responds: `Synchronizer.refreshExchangeRateUSD()`,
  `TorClient.getExchangeRateUSD()`, and every lightwalletd call the SDK sends over Tor.
- `TorClient.httpRequest(for:retryLimit:)` rejects a `URLRequest` whose URL scheme is neither `http`
  nor `https` instead of sending it as plaintext HTTP.

# 2.7.0-rc.3 - 2026-07-28

## Changed
- `proposeTransfer` and `proposefulfillingPaymentURI`: once NU6.3 is active, a single payment whose
  value is a canonical ZIP 318 denomination (a `{1, 2, 5} * 10^k` amount from 0.01 to 10,000 ZEC)
  crossing the Orchard turnstile is proposed as a canonical crossing. Such a proposal pays one fewer

  `ZcashTransaction.Overview.hasChange` was `false` while the note was counted in `receivedNoteCount`

  or expired status resolved during enhancement.
- Calls routed over Tor time out instead of hanging indefinitely against a server that accepts a
  connection and then never responds: `Synchronizer.refreshExchangeRateUSD()`,
  `TorClient.getExchangeRateUSD()`, and every lightwalletd call the SDK sends over Tor.
- `TorClient.httpRequest(for:retryLimit:)` rejects a `URLRequest` whose URL scheme is neither `http`
  nor `https` instead of sending it as plaintext HTTP.

# v2.8.0-rc.1 - 2026-07-26

## Added
- `ZcashError.initializerSeedMismatch` (`ZINIT0006`):
  `Synchronizer.prepare` / `Initializer.initialize` now validate the supplied
  seed against the wallet's existing seed-derived accounts and throw instead of
  silently opening a wallet the seed cannot spend from (previously the app's
  keychain seed and the on-disk account could diverge, so the wallet displayed
  and received funds at an address it could not spend from). Restoring a
  different wallet requires `wipe()` first. Wallets whose only accounts are
  imported (hardware-wallet UFVKs) are exempt: there is no seed-derived account
  to compare against. See MIGRATING.md.
- `CreatedTransaction`, `SubmissionTiming`, `TransactionSubmissionOutcome`, and
  `TransactionSubmissionReport`: the value types of the reworked `Broadcaster`
  submission API (see Changed).
- `LightWalletEndpoint` now conforms to `Equatable`.

## Changed
- `Broadcaster` has been redesigned for submission to multiple servers. This is
  a breaking change; see MIGRATING.md.
  - `createProposedTransactions` / `createTransactionFromPCZT` return
    `[CreatedTransaction]` (with non-optional `raw` bytes) instead of
    `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]`. `CreatedTransaction(overview:)` rebuilds one
    from a stored overview, e.g. to submit a transaction created in an earlier
    session.
  - `submit(_ rawTransaction: Data, to: LightWalletEndpoint)` is replaced by
    `submit(transaction:to:timing:)`, which submits to all supplied endpoints in
    parallel — first acceptance wins, the remaining submissions get a grace
    window — and returns a `TransactionSubmissionOutcome` instead of throwing.
    `submit(transactions:to:timing:)` submits a batch sequentially and stops at
    the first transaction that is not accepted.
  - The endpoints passed to `submit` are recorded as the transaction's retry
    plan. Background resubmission retries pending transactions through their
    recorded endpoints rather than the synchronizer's default endpoint, and
    never auto-submits a `Broadcaster`-created transaction the app has not
    submitted itself. Plans are kept until the transaction expires, so a chain
    reorg cannot detach a transaction from its endpoints, and
    `Synchronizer.wipe()` deletes them.
  - The retry plan is recorded before any network attempt and survives
    `.cancelled` and `.timedOut`, so both mean "outcome unknown", not "not
    sent"; the transaction may still be broadcast later.
  - With Tor enabled, each endpoint submission uses an isolated Tor client.
- `Initializer.InitializationResult` gained a `.seedNotRelevant` case, returned
  by `Initializer.initialize` and `Synchronizer.prepare` when the rust layer
  reports that the provided seed is not relevant to the wallet database.
  Previously this was indistinguishable from `.success`, so callers proceeded as
  if they had prepared the wallet they expected even when the database on disk
  belonged to a different wallet (for example, a device-backup restore that
  brings back `data.db` without the matching keychain seed). This is a breaking
  change: exhaustive switches over `InitializationResult` must handle
  `.seedNotRelevant` — treat it as you already treat `.seedRequired`. See
  MIGRATING.md.
- New wallets take their birthday from a recent lightwalletd tree state below
  the reorg horizon instead of the bundled checkpoint, cutting first-launch
  scanning while remaining reorg-safe. Falls back to the bundled checkpoint when
  the server is unreachable.

- The lightwalletd protobuf definitions (`compact_formats.proto`,
  `service.proto`) are now vendored from
  https://github.com/zcash/lightwallet-protocol as a git subtree under
  `lightwallet-protocol/`, currently at v0.5.0, and the generated Swift
  sources have been regenerated from it. Future updates should use
  `Scripts/update-lightwallet-protocol.sh <ref>`, which pulls the subtree and
  regenerates the sources (a nix dev shell providing `protoc` is available
  via the new `flake.nix`). Protocol v0.5.0 renames `CompactTx.hash` to
  `CompactTx.txid`, removes `CompactTx.protoVersion`, and adds transparent
  `vin`/`vout` data, the `PoolType` enum, `BlockRange.poolTypes`, and new
  `LightdInfo` fields; these generated types are internal to the SDK, so the
  public API is unchanged.
- Transparent-address transaction enhancement now uses the
  `GetTaddressTransactions` RPC in place of the deprecated (and otherwise
  identical) `GetTaddressTxids`, so it requires a lightwalletd new enough to
  serve lightwallet-protocol v0.3.6 (lightwalletd v0.4.18, 2025-05) or newer.
  The public `ZcashError.serviceGetTaddressTxidsFailed` case is unchanged
  aside from its message text.

## Fixed
- Tor-layer errors (`rustTorConnectToLightwalletd`, `rustTorLwdGetInfo`,
  `rustTorLwdSubmit`, `rustTorLwdFetchTransaction`,
  `rustTorLwdLatestBlockHeight`, `rustTorLwdGetTreeState`) are now treated as
  retryable service errors. Previously they bypassed the retry path and became a
  fatal sync failure, so a transient Tor circuit or stream problem required a
  full app restart to recover. They now trigger the same reset-and-retry
  behaviour as other transport errors, including tearing down cached Tor
  connections, up to `ZcashSDK.serviceFailureRetries` times.
- Server-streaming gRPC calls (UTXO fetch, subtree roots, transparent-address
  transactions, block ranges) now use the endpoint's streaming-call timeout
  rather than its single-call timeout, fixing spurious
  `[ZUTXO0001] Awaiting transactions from the stream failed` and equivalent
  failures on long streams.
- `Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` and
  `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPCZT` no longer emit
  `TransactionSubmitResult.submitFailure` for a transaction the server already
  has: on a non-zero submit error code the SDK asks the same lightwalletd
  whether the txid is in mempool or chain and emits
  `TransactionSubmitResult.success` if it is. This covers Zebra's
  `MempoolError::InMempool` / `AlreadyQueued` and zcashd's "already in chain"
  without depending on backend-specific error codes or message text.
- An unmined sent transaction whose expiry height has passed is now reported as
  `.expired` even when the wallet database's `expired_unmined` flag has not been
  updated. Such transactions — in particular sends left unmined across a
  consensus-rule change — previously stayed `.pending` indefinitely.
- Transaction enhancement now retries the write that follows a successful fetch,
  so a transient write failure no longer leaves a transaction un-enhanced after
  a single attempt.
- Background resubmission no longer re-broadcasts a freshly submitted
  transaction during the first sync cycle of a session; its five-minute throttle
  now applies from the first invocation.
- Tearing down a lightwalletd connection now releases its event-loop threads.
  Each ephemeral connection — one per endpoint per `Broadcaster` submission
  attempt — previously leaked a thread for the lifetime of the process.

## Removed
- The shielded voting surface (`VotingRustBackend`, the public `Voting*` types,
  `PirSnapshotResolver`/`PirSnapshotProbing`/`HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`, and the
  `zcashlc_voting_*` FFI symbols) is not shipped. `zcash_voting` cannot resolve
  against the Ironwood `orchard` release, so voting is withheld until the voting
  crates support it. This is a breaking change only for wallets upgrading from a
  2.6.0-alpha tag; the surface was already absent from 2.7.0-rc.1 onward. See
  MIGRATING.md.

# 2.7.0-rc.2 - 2026-07-26

## Changed
- The lightwalletd protobuf definitions (`compact_formats.proto`,
  `service.proto`) are now vendored from
  https://github.com/zcash/lightwallet-protocol as a git subtree under
  `lightwallet-protocol/`, currently at v0.5.0, and the generated Swift
  sources have been regenerated from it. Future updates should use
  `Scripts/update-lightwallet-protocol.sh <ref>`, which pulls the subtree and
  regenerates the sources (a nix dev shell providing `protoc` is available
  via the new `flake.nix`). Protocol v0.5.0 renames `CompactTx.hash` to
  `CompactTx.txid`, removes `CompactTx.protoVersion`, and adds transparent
  `vin`/`vout` data, the `PoolType` enum, `BlockRange.poolTypes`, and new
  `LightdInfo` fields; these generated types are internal to the SDK, so the
  public API is unchanged.
- Transparent-address transaction enhancement now uses the
  `GetTaddressTransactions` RPC in place of the deprecated (and otherwise
  identical) `GetTaddressTxids`. This raises the minimum server requirement:
  the SDK now needs a lightwalletd serving lightwallet-protocol v0.3.6 or
  newer (lightwalletd v0.4.18, 2025-05). Against an older server, enhancement
  of transparent transactions fails rather than falling back.
  `ZcashError.serviceGetTaddressTxidsFailed` is unchanged apart from its
  message text.
- Adding proofs to a PCZT now reuses a cached Orchard-family proving key
  across the Orchard and Ironwood proofs (both use the same PostNu6_3
  circuit after NU6.3) instead of rebuilding the key for each, and derives
  the Ironwood circuit version from the PCZT's consensus branch id rather
  than hardcoding it. The resulting proofs are unchanged.

## Fixed
- Hardware-wallet signing of post-NU6.3 (v6) transactions: the
  wallet-controlled zero-value Orchard spends that pad such transactions now
  carry ZIP 32 derivation metadata (via `zcash_client_backend 0.24.0-rc.4`),
  so signers can identify and sign them. Previously these actions were
  unsignable and v6 sends failed at finalization with a missing
  spend-auth-signature error even though the device approved the
  transaction.
- Redacting a PCZT for an external signer now requests
  `zcash_client_backend`'s full (non-compacted) signer view, and the PCZT
  encoding sent to the signer is the minimal version capable of representing
  its content (v1 for v5 transactions). The compact signer view previously
  adopted here requires receiver capabilities (v2 PCZT encoding,
  compact-field resolution) that deployed hardware-signer firmware does not
  provide in its ordinary signing flow, causing Keystone sends to fail at
  finalization with a missing-signature error. The Ironwood bundle redaction
  is preserved: the full view clears Ironwood spend witnesses and output
  metadata alongside the other bundles.

# 2.7.0-rc.1 - 2026-07-25

## Added
- Ironwood (NU6.3) receive/sync readiness. `AccountBalance.ironwoodBalance`
  exposes the Ironwood (Orchard note-version V3) pool balance alongside sapling
  and orchard (masked with them while the chain tip is stale). The lightwalletd
  protocol gains the Ironwood fields (`CompactTx.ironwoodActions`,
  `ChainMetadata.ironwoodCommitmentTreeSize`, `TreeState.ironwoodTree`,
  `ShieldedProtocol.ironwood`); `UpdateSubtreeRootsAction` fetches and stores
  Ironwood subtree roots (best-effort, skipping when the server does not serve
  them); and checkpoints can carry an `ironwoodTree` state. The path is dormant
  until NU6.3 activates and a lightwalletd serves the fields.

## Changed
- Bumped the Rust dependency stack to the Ironwood (NU6.3) crates.io releases
  (`orchard` 0.14→0.15, `zcash_client_backend` 0.23→0.24.0-rc.2,
  `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.21→0.22.0-rc.2, `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs`
  0.28→0.30, `zcash_protocol` 0.9→0.10, `zcash_address` 0.12→0.13,
  `zcash_transparent` 0.8→0.10, `pczt` 0.7→0.8, `zcash_keys` 0.14→0.16)
  and dropped the `[patch.crates-io]` git overrides, matching the Android SDK's
  2.5.x dependency set. `addProofsToPCZT` now also proves Ironwood bundles.
- Once NU6.3 activates, a payment to an Orchard receiver is delivered through
  the Ironwood bundle of a version 6 transaction rather than as an Orchard
  output: a `Proposal` reports such payments and the change from Ironwood
  spends as Ironwood-pool outputs, and `createProposedTransactions` and
  `createPCZTFromProposal` build the version 6 transaction that carries them.
- Fee and change calculation derive the Orchard bundle version from the
  proposal's target height instead of always applying the pre-NU6.3 policy, so
  a proposal targeting a height at or beyond NU6.3 activation is charged one
  ZIP 317 action per Orchard spend or output rather than
  `max(spends, outputs)`, and Ironwood spends, outputs and change are charged
  against the separate Ironwood bundle. Proposals below the activation height
  are unaffected.

## Removed
- The shielded voting surface (`VotingRustBackend`, the public `Voting*` types,
  `PirSnapshotResolver`/`PirSnapshotProbing`/`HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`, and the
  `zcashlc_voting_*` FFI). `zcash_voting` cannot resolve against the Ironwood
  `orchard` release, so voting is not shipped on the 2.5.x line, matching the
  Android SDK.

## Fixed
- `deleteAccount(_:)` no longer fails with a rusqlite
  `InvalidParameterName(":address")` error when the account being deleted is
  recorded as the recipient of one of its own sent outputs, as happens after
  an internal transfer to that account. Wallets on the 2.6 line received this
  fix in 2.6.0-alpha.6.

# 2.6.0-alpha.6 - 2026-06-26

## Added
- `BlockEnhancer` now emits structured diagnostic logs at each step of an enhance cycle — cycle start with request count, per-request type and attempt, fetch response shape (status, whether a tx was returned, whether a `minedHeight` was set), the decision taken (`setTransactionStatus` or `decryptAndStoreTransaction`), per-attempt errors with error type, retry exhaustion, and cycle completion. Logs use opaque per-request correlation IDs (no transaction ids, addresses, or other PII) so production logs are debuggable for future stuck-transaction reports without exposing user-identifying data.

## Fixed
- `Synchronizer.deleteAccount(_:)` no longer fails with an `InvalidParameterName` error when deleting an account that is referenced by a cross-account transaction — for example, disconnecting a Keystone hardware-wallet account after funds were transferred between it and another account in the same wallet. Fixed upstream in `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.21.1 ([librustzcash#2426](https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash/pull/2426)); the bundled `libzcashlc` now builds against that version.
- `BlockEnhancer` retry loop now covers the post-fetch write step (`setTransactionStatus` / `decryptAndStoreTransaction`) on the `.getStatus` and `.enhancement` branches. Previously `retry = false` was set immediately after the fetch returned, so a write failure short-circuited the loop after one attempt and the new "retry exhausted" diagnostic never fired — exactly the stuck-transaction signature this PR is meant to make diagnosable. The `.transactionsInvolvingAddress` branch already had the correct ordering; the three cases are now consistent.
- `TxResubmissionAction.latestResolvedTime` now seeds to the current wall-clock time at construction instead of `0`. The previous zero-init made the 5-minute throttle a no-op on the action's first invocation (`diff = now - 0` is ~56 years, well over the 300s threshold), so the action could re-broadcast a freshly-submitted transaction during the very first sync cycle of the session. The throttle now engages on first invocation as intended.

## Changed
- New wallets now use a recent tree state from the lightwalletd server as the wallet birthday, reducing unnecessary block scanning on first launch while retaining reorg safety. Falls back to the bundled checkpoint if the server is unreachable.
- `Broadcaster` has been redesigned for multi-server submission (breaking change to the 2.6.0-alpha API; see MIGRATING.md):
  - `createProposedTransactions` / `createTransactionFromPCZT` now return `[CreatedTransaction]` (with non-optional raw bytes) instead of `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]`.
  - `submit(_:to:)` (raw bytes, single endpoint) has been replaced by `submit(transaction:to:timing:)` which submits to multiple endpoints in parallel — first acceptance wins, remaining submissions get a grace window — and returns a `TransactionSubmissionOutcome` instead of throwing. A batch variant `submit(transactions:to:timing:)` submits sequentially and stops at the first transaction that isn't accepted.
  - The endpoints used for submission are recorded as the transaction's retry plan (persisted in the SDK's general storage). Background resubmission retries pending transactions through their recorded endpoints, skips transactions created through `Broadcaster` that were never submitted, and keeps the default-endpoint behavior for everything else. The plan store fails safe (resubmission skips affected transactions when the store is unreadable), keeps plans until the transaction expires so a chain reorg cannot detach a transaction from its endpoints, and `Synchronizer.wipe()` deletes the plan database file.
  - Cancelling the task that awaits `submit` resolves `.cancelled` promptly; the recorded retry plan stays in place (see MIGRATING.md).
  - With Tor enabled, each endpoint submission uses an isolated Tor client so one stalled endpoint cannot serialize the parallel race.
  - `CreatedTransaction` and `TransactionSubmissionReport` gained public initializers so custom `Broadcaster` conformers and test doubles can construct them.
  - `LightWalletEndpoint` now conforms to `Equatable`.

## Fixed
- `LightWalletGRPCService` now shuts down its NIO event loop group in `stop()`, fixing a thread leak for every ephemeral connection (one per endpoint per `Broadcaster` submission attempt).
- `Synchronizer.submitTransactions` now verifies submit failures against the server before surfacing them: when the submit RPC returns a non-zero error code, the SDK immediately asks the same lightwalletd whether the tx is known via `GetTransaction`, and reclassifies the result as `TransactionSubmitResult.success` if the server reports the tx is in mempool or chain. This covers the cases that previously produced misleading failure UIs — Zebra's `MempoolError::InMempool` / `AlreadyQueued`, zcashd's `RPC_VERIFY_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN`, and any future "already known" variant we don't recognise — without depending on backend-specific error codes or message text.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.State.init` now accepts an optional `expiryHeight:` argument and treats an unmined transaction whose `expiryHeight` is at or below the supplied `currentHeight` as `.expired` even when the `expiredUnmined` column hasn't been flipped to `true`. This makes the Swift-side state-machine resilient to lagging or missed updates of that column (in particular: sent transactions that were unmined when the wallet migrated across a consensus-rule change, which previously stayed reported as `.pending` indefinitely). Existing call sites that don't pass `expiryHeight` keep their prior behaviour.

# 2.6.0-alpha.5

This release updates from 2.6.0-alpha.4 to fix premature timeouts on UTXO and
other server-streaming gRPC calls (`[ZUTXO0001]`).

## Fixed
- Fixed `[ZUTXO0001] Awaiting transactions from the stream failed` (and the same
  latent timeout on the subtree-root, transparent-address-txid, and block-range
  streams): these server-streaming gRPC calls now use the streaming-call timeout
  instead of the shorter single-call timeout.

# 2.6.0-alpha.4 - 2026-06-04

This release updates from 2.6.0-alpha.3 to integrate support for the NU6.2
network upgrade.

## Changed
- Updated the Rust dependency stack to the released crates.io versions carried
  by 2.5.2 below, including `zcash_protocol` 0.9, which sets the NU6.2
  activation heights (mainnet 3364600, testnet 4052000). Transactions
  targeting those heights and above are built against the NU6.2 consensus
  branch id.

# 2.5.2 - 2026-06-03

## Changed
- Updated the Rust dependency stack to released crates.io versions
  (`orchard` 0.13.1→0.14, `zcash_client_backend` 0.22→0.23,
  `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.20.2→0.21, `zcash_keys` 0.13→0.14,
  `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs` 0.27→0.28, `zcash_protocol` 0.8→0.9,
  `zcash_address` 0.11→0.12, `zcash_transparent` 0.7→0.8, `pczt` 0.6→0.7).
  `zcash_protocol` 0.9 carries the NU6.2 activation heights (mainnet 3364600,
  testnet 4052000), so transactions targeting those heights and above are now
  built against the NU6.2 consensus branch id. The public Swift API is
  unchanged.

# 2.6.0-alpha.3 - 2026-05-27

## Changed
- Updated `zcash_voting` to 0.10.1, taken from the released crate rather than a
  git revision.

# 2.6.0-alpha.2 - 2026-05-18

## Added
- `VotingRustBackend.generateHotkey(seed:)`, deriving a `VotingHotkey` from the
  wallet seed.

## Changed
- Updated `zcash_voting` to 0.8.1 (from 0.6.0).

# 2.5.1 - 2026-05-14

## Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could cause transactions shielding more than 150 transparent
  P2PKH inputs to fail due to incorrect fee computation.

# 2.6.0-alpha.1 - 2026-05-12

## Added
- A Swift wrapper over the `zcashlc_voting_*` FFI introduced in 2.5.0:
  `VotingRustBackend` (voting-database handle, round setup and state, vote
  commitment and share-payload construction, share encryption, delegation PIR
  precomputation, vote-tree sync, VAN and note witness generation, and the
  vote/delegation transaction-hash store), the public `Voting*` value types,
  and `PirSnapshotResolver` / `PirSnapshotProbing` / `HTTPPirSnapshotProbe` for
  selecting a PIR snapshot server. This surface was removed again in
  2.7.0-rc.1.

# 2.5.0 - 2026-05-11

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.rescanFrom(height:)`: Rescans the chain from the given BlockHeight.
- `SynchronizerState.fullyScannedHeight`: Contiguous-from-birthday scan high-water mark published on `stateStream`/`latestState`. Callers that need an authoritative view of the wallet's note and nullifier state at a specific height (for example, balance anchored at a poll snapshot) should gate on this rather than `latestBlockHeight` (chain tip) or `maxScannedHeight` (head-first scan progress, which can race ahead under Spend-before-Sync).
- `Synchronizer.getTreeState(height:)`: Fetches the commitment tree state at the given block height from lightwalletd and returns the protobuf-serialized `TreeState` bytes, for app-layer consumers that need to hand tree state to an external component (for example, witness generation via FFI). A throwing default implementation keeps the addition source-compatible for downstream `Synchronizer` conformers.
- `zcash_voting` dependency foundation: SDK Rust crate now depends on `zcash_voting 0.5.7` (`default-features = false`, `client-pir`, `client-tree-sync`) and exposes pure-function FFI symbols for share-nullifier computation and PIR proof validation.
- `PirSnapshotResolver`, `PirSnapshotResolverError`, `PirSnapshotProbeOutcome`, `PirSnapshotProbing`, and `HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`: Select a vote-nullifier PIR endpoint whose `/root` metadata exactly matches a voting round's expected snapshot height.
- `Voting*` Swift types: public type contract for the shielded voting FFI boundary, in `Sources/ZcashLightClientKit/Rust/Voting/VotingTypes.swift`.
- `VotingRustBackend`: Swift wrapper for the voting `libzcashlc` surface. A `final class` that owns an opaque `VotingDatabaseHandle` for the duration of a voting session. Exposes:
  - Database lifecycle: `init()`, `open(path:)`, `close()` (idempotent), and `deinit` cleanup, over `zcashlc_voting_db_open` / `zcashlc_voting_db_free`.
  - `setWalletId(_:)` over `zcashlc_voting_set_wallet_id`.
  - `precomputeDelegationPir(roundId:bundleIndex:notes:pirEndpoints:expectedSnapshotHeight:networkId:pirResolver:)` over `zcashlc_voting_precompute_delegation_pir`, with `PirSnapshotResolver`-driven endpoint selection.
  - `generateNoteWitnesses(roundId:bundleIndex:walletDbPath:notes:networkId:)` over `zcashlc_voting_generate_note_witnesses`.
  - Vote-tree sync: `syncVoteTree(roundId:nodeUrl:)`, `generateVanWitness(roundId:bundleIndex:anchorHeight:)`, and `resetTreeClient(roundId:)` over the corresponding `zcashlc_voting_sync_vote_tree` / `_generate_van_witness` / `_reset_tree_client` FFI.
  - Vote casting: `encryptShares(roundId:shares:)`, `buildVoteCommitment(roundId:bundleIndex:hotkeySeed:networkId:proposalId:choice:numOptions:vanWitness:singleShare:progress:)`, `buildSharePayloads(commitment:voteDecision:numOptions:voteCommitmentTreePosition:singleShare:)`, `markVoteSubmitted(roundId:bundleIndex:proposalId:)`, and `signCastVote(hotkeySeed:networkId:commitment:)`.
  - The static `computeShareNullifier(voteCommitment:shareIndex:primaryBlind:)` over `zcashlc_voting_compute_share_nullifier`, with 32-byte input validation.
  - `VotingRustBackendError` cases `databaseAlreadyOpen` / `databaseNotOpen` for handle-state errors, alongside the existing `rustError` and `invalidData`.
- Extends `VotingRustBackend` with additional FFI wrappers and their FFI mappings:

  Foundation helpers (static)

  - `setupBundles(roundId:notes:)` → `zcashlc_voting_setup_bundles` (frees `FfiBundleSetupResult` via `zcashlc_voting_free_bundle_setup_result`)

  - `buildAndProveDelegation(roundId:bundleIndex:notes:hotkeyRawAddress:pirEndpoints:expectedSnapshotHeight:networkId:pirResolver:progress:)` (`async`, resolves the PIR snapshot endpoint, then runs proving on a detached `Task`) → `zcashlc_voting_build_and_prove_delegation` (with progress callback bridge)
- `Broadcaster` protocol — separates transaction creation from submission, enabling custom broadcast strategies (e.g. submitting to multiple lightwalletd servers in parallel).
  - `Broadcaster.createProposedTransactions(proposal:spendingKey:)` — creates transactions locally without broadcasting, returning `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]` with raw bytes.
  - `Broadcaster.createTransactionFromPCZT(pcztWithProofs:pcztWithSigs:)` — extracts and stores a transaction from PCZT data without submitting.
  - `Broadcaster.submit(_:to:)` — submits raw transaction bytes to a specific `LightWalletEndpoint`. Respects Tor configuration.
- `Synchronizer.broadcaster` property, also exposed through the closure and Combine synchronizer facades, to access the `Broadcaster` from SDK synchronizer instances.
- `libzcashlc` voting tree-sync FFI: `zcashlc_voting_sync_vote_tree`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_van_witness`, and `zcashlc_voting_reset_tree_client`. Operate on the existing `VotingDatabaseHandle`, which also carries a `zcash_voting::tree_sync::VoteTreeSync` constructed in `zcashlc_voting_db_open`.
- `libzcashlc` voting wallet-notes FFI: `zcashlc_voting_get_wallet_notes`. Loads unspent Orchard notes for a wallet account at a snapshot height and returns them as a JSON-encoded `Vec<NoteInfo>`, suitable as the `notes` input to `zcashlc_voting_precompute_delegation_pir`. `account_uuid` must be a non-null pointer to exactly 16 bytes; otherwise the call fails (returns null).
- `libzcashlc` voting key-utility FFI: `zcashlc_voting_extract_orchard_fvk_from_ufvk`. Decodes a UFVK string and returns the raw 96-byte Orchard FVK. Returns null on missing Orchard component, malformed UFVK, or invalid `network_id`.
- `libzcashlc` voting utility FFI: `zcashlc_voting_warm_proving_caches`, `zcashlc_voting_decompose_weight`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_delegation_inputs`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_delegation_inputs_with_fvk`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_pczt_sighash`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_spend_auth_sig`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_nc_root`, and `zcashlc_voting_verify_witness`. These cover voting proof setup, PCZT/signature extraction, note-commitment root extraction, and witness verification.
- `libzcashlc` voting witness FFI: `zcashlc_voting_generate_note_witnesses`. Generates Orchard Merkle inclusion witnesses for a bundle's notes anchored at the round's snapshot height. Adds `incrementalmerkletree 0.8` as a direct Rust dependency.
- `libzcashlc` voting round, recovery, and delegation workflow FFI: adds C-compatible return structs and free helpers, persisted round-state APIs, crash-recovery metadata helpers, share-delegation tracking, hotkey and bundle setup, delegation PCZT/proof generation, delegation submission payloads, and VAN position persistence.
- `libzcashlc` vote-casting FFI: encrypts vote shares, builds vote commitments and share payloads, marks submitted votes, and signs cast-vote transactions.

## Changed
- Bumped Rust dependencies to current crates.io releases (`zcash_address` 0.10→0.11, `zcash_client_backend` 0.21→0.22, `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.19→0.20, `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs` 0.26→0.27, `zcash_protocol` 0.7→0.8, `zcash_transparent` 0.6→0.7, `sapling-crypto` 0.6→0.7, `orchard` 0.12→0.13, `pczt` 0.5→0.6) and removed the `[patch.crates-io]` git-rev overrides. No public Swift API changes.
- Pinned `orchard` to `=0.13.1` and enabled its `unstable-voting-circuits` feature, required transitively by `zcash_voting`. No public Swift API changes.
- `SDKSyncrhonizer.importAccount` extended with `birthday: BlockHeight?`. Leaving the default `nil` value sets the chain tip, otherwise given `birthday` height is used.
- Enabled the `client-tree-sync` feature on `zcash_voting`, required by the new voting tree-sync FFI listed above.
- Added `zcash_keys 0.13` (`orchard` feature) as a Rust dependency, used by the new voting wallet-notes, key-utility, and utility FFI to decode UFVKs and derive Orchard FVKs. No public Swift API changes.
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.5.7` so `network_id` matches the SDK (`0` = testnet, `1` = mainnet) end-to-end for wallet-notes JSON consumed by delegation PIR, and submitted-vote marking fails when no persisted vote row matches. No public Swift API changes.

## Fixed
- `Transport became inactive` connectivity issue.
- `NIOHTTP2` connectivity issues.

  - `memo(Blob?) -> String?`: prints the given blob as a string if it is a text memo, and as hex-encoded bytes otherwise.

- `SDKSynchronizer.estimateTimestamp(for height: Blockheight)`: Get an estimated timestamp for a given block height.

- `SDKSynchronizer.enhanceTransactionBy(txId)` Calls an enhance action for a given txId.

# 2.4.0 - 2025-11-10

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.getSingleUseTransparentAddress` Get an ephemeral single use transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.checkSingleUseTransparentAddresses` Checks to find any single-use ephemeral addresses exposed in the past day that have not yet received funds, excluding any whose next check time is in the future. This will then choose the address that is most overdue for checking, retrieve any UTXOs for that address over Tor, and add them to the wallet database. 
- `SDKSynchronizer.updateTransparentAddressTransactions` Finds all transactions associated with the given transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.fetchUTXOsBy(address)` Checks to find any UTXOs associated with the given transparent address. This check will cover the block range starting at the exposure height for that address, if known, or otherwise at the birthday height of the specified account.

## Fixed
- [2.3.6 change] Transparent funds are now reported after `UpdateChainTipAction` is processed. Attempt to shield before this action has been failing otherwise. Update: the solution handled only cold start of a client, now it resets the logic with each stop() call of the SDK.
- Updated to zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.9 to fix problems in transparent UTXO selection for shielding, including incorrect handling of outputs received at ephemeral addresses and selection of dust transparent outputs for shielding.

## Fixed
- The backend method proposeShielding checks the pointer for a null value before attempting to construct the Data with it. Without this check, proposeShielding would crash when there were either zero funds to shield or when the amount was less than the threshold defined by the client.

# 2.1.5 - 2024-04-18

  instead of a fixed fee of 10,000 Zatoshi. Use `Proposal.totalFeeRequired` to check the
  total fee for a transfer before creating it.

## Added

### [#1204] Expose APIs for working with transaction proposals
New `Synchronizer` APIs that enable constructing a proposal for transferring or
shielding funds, and then creating transactions from a proposal. The intermediate
proposal can be used to determine the required fee, before committing to producing
transactions.

The old `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` APIs have been
deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.0 (which will create multiple transactions
at once for some recipients).

# 2.0.10 - 2024-02-12

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch` will perform a check to ensure that it's possible to communicate with the specified lightwalletd server, which may result in an an error. If this check fails, the user should be prompted to check the address, port and verify that the `address:port` format is respected.
- Switching endpoints causes a call to `synchronizer.Start()`, which may throw a `ZcashError`.

## Changed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
`SynchronizerState` cleaned up and changed to provide only `AccountBalance`. This struct holds `saplingBalance: PoolBalance` which represents shielded balance for both total and spendable. Also holds `unshielded: Zatoshi` which represents transparent balance.

## Removed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
- `WalletBalance` has been removed from the SDK, replaced with `AccountBalance`.
- `getTransparentBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead

# 2.0.9 - 2024-01-31

## Changed

### [#1363] Account balances in the SynchronizerState
`shieldedBalance: WalletBalance` has been replaced with `accountBalances: AccountBalance`. `AccountBalance` provides the same values as `shieldedBalance` but adds up a pending changes. Under the hood this calls rust's `getWalletSummary` which improved also the syncing initial values of % and balances.

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch`: endpoint fails, check the address, port and format address:port,
- Some `ZcashError` related to `synchronizer.Start()`: the switch calls `start()` at the end and that is the only throwing function except the validation.

# 2.0.8 - 2024-01-30

Adopt `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.5.1`. This fixes a serialization problem
broke shielding.

# 2.0.7 - 2024-01-29

## Added
- `Model.ScanSummary`
- `Model.WalletSummary.{PoolBalance, AccountBalance, WalletSummary}`

## Changed
- The `ZcashError` type has changed.
  - Added variant `rustGetWalletSummary`
  - Removed variants:
    - `rustGetVerifiedBalance` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
    - `rustGetScanProgress` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
    - `rustGetBalance` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
- The performance of `getWalletSummary` and `scanBlocks` have been improved.

# 2.0.6 - 2024-01-28

## Changed

### [#1346] Troubleshooting synchronization
We focused on performance of the synchronization and found out a root cause in progress reporting. Simple change reduced the synchronization significantly by reporting less frequently. This affect the UX a bit because the % of the sync is updated only every 500 scanned blocks instead of every 100. Proper solution is going to be handled in #1353.

### [#1351] Recover from block stream issues
Async block stream grpc calls sometimes fail with unknown error 14, most of the times represented as `Transport became inactive` or `NIOHTTP2.StreamClosed`. Unless the service is truly down, these errors are usually false positive ones. The SDK was able to recover from this error with the next sync triggered but it takes 10-30s to happen. This delay is unnecessary so we made 2 changes. When these errors are caught the next sync is triggered immediately (at most 3 times) + the error state is not passed to the clients.

The enhancing of the transactions now processes all the blocks suggested by scan ranges. The issue was that when new scan ranges were suggested the value that drives the enhancing range computation wasn't reset, so when higher ranges were processed, the lower ranges were skipped. This fix ensures all transaction data are properly set, as well as fixing eventStream `.foundTransaction` reporting.

### Fix incorrect note deduplication in v_transactions (librustzcash)
This is a fix in the rust layer. The amount sent in the transaction was incorrectly reported even though the actual amount was sent properly. Now clients should see the amount they expect to see in the UI.

# 2.0.2 - 2023-10-12

## Changed

### [#1303] Don't invalidate the timer with the error
The SDK has some simple logic of retrying when some erros occurs. There were 5 attempts of retry until the SDK stopped the synchronization process completely. (The timer is not restarted after those). That approach led to some annoying UX issue of manually starting the SDKSynchronizer from the client, shifting the responsibility to the devs/clients. This has been changed, the SDK never stops the timer unless `synchronizer.stop()` is called.

## Fixed

### [#1301] foundTransactions don't emit after rewind
The `.foundTransactions` observed on eventStream worked well during the sync until the rewind was called. That API missed reset of the ActionContext in the CompactBlockProcesser and that led to never observing the same transactions again. This ticket fixed the problem, reset is called in the rewind and new sync passes the transactions to the stream.

# 2.0.1 - 2023-10-03

## Changed

### [#1294] Remove all uses of the incorrect 1000-ZAT fee
The 1000 Zatoshi fee proposed in ZIP-313 is deprecated now and so the minimum is 10k Zatoshi, defined in ZIP-317.
The SDK has been cleaned up from deprecated fee but note, real fee is handled in a rust layer.
The public API `NetworkConstants.defaultFee(for: BlockHeight)` has been refactored to `NetworkConstants.defaultFee()`.

# 2.0.0 - 2023-09-25

## Notable Changes

This release updates `ZcashLightClientKit` to implement the Spend-Before-Sync fast
synchronization algorithm.

## Changed

Updated dependencies:
- `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.4.0`

`CompactBlockProcessor` now processes compact blocks from the lightwalletd server with Spend-before-Sync algorithm (i.e. non-linear order). This feature shortens the time after which a wallet's spendable balance can be used.

### [#1196] Check logging level priorities
The levels for logging have been updated according to Log Levels in Swift. (https://www.swift.org/server/guides/libraries/log-levels.html).
There's one naming difference, instead of `notice` we use `event`. So the order is debug, info, event, warning, error.

### [#1111] Change how the sync progress is stored inside the SDK

`Initializer` has now a new parameter called `generalStorageURL`. This URL is the location of the directory
where the SDK can store any information it needs. A directory doesn't have to exist. But the SDK must
be able to write to this location after it creates this directory. It is suggested that this directory is
a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

Synchronizer's prepare(...) public API changed: `viewingKeys:
[UnifiedFullViewingKey]` has been removed and `for walletMode: WalletInitMode`
added. `WalletInitMode` is an enum with 3 cases: .newWallet, .restoreWallet and
.existingWallet. Use `.newWallet` when preparing the SDKSynchronizer for a
brand new wallet that has been generated. Use `.restoreWallet` when wallet is
about to be restored from a seed and `.existingWallet` for all other scenarios.

## Removed

### [#1181] Correct computation of progress for Spend before Sync
`latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from `SynchronizerState`. With multiple algorithms
of syncing the amount of data provided is reduced so it's consistent. Spend before Sync is done in non-linear order
so both Height and Time don't make sense anymore.

### [#1230] Remove linear sync from the SDK

- `latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from the
  SynchronizerState.
- The concept of pending transaction has changed: `func allPendingTransactions()`
  is no longer available. Use `public func allTransactions()` instead.

## Fixed

- [#1037] Empty string memo throws `ZcashError.memoTextInputEndsWithNullBytes`
- [#1016] Rebuild download stream periodically while downloading
This fixes a memory consumption issue coming from GRPC-Swift.
- [#1019] Memo has trailing garbled text

### [#1111] Change how the sync progress is stored inside the SDK

`Initializer` has now a new parameter called `generalStorageURL`. This URL is the location of the directory
where the SDK can store any information it needs. A directory doesn't have to exist. But the SDK must
be able to write to this location after it creates this directory. It is suggested that this directory is
a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

### [#1019] Memo has trailing garbled text

Changes the way unpadded bytes are turned into a UTF-8 Swift String
without using cString assuming APIs that would overflow memory and
add garbled trailing bytes.

- [#781] This fixes test `testMaxAmountMinusOneSend` by creating two separate tests:
  - testMaxAmountMinusOneSendFails
  - testMaxAmountSend

Also includes new functionality that tracks sent transactions so
that users can be notified specifically when they are mined and uses "idea B" of
issue #1033.

closes #1033
closes #781

### [#1001] Remove PendingDb in favor of `v_transactions` and `v_tx_output` Views

## Changed

- `WalletTransactionEncoder` now uses a `LightWalletService` to submit the
encoded transactions.

- Functions returning or receiving `ZcashTransaction.Sent` or `ZcashTransaction.Received` now
will be simplified by returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` or be replaced by their Overview
counterparts

## Added

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview` can be checked for "pending-ness" by calling`.isPending(latestHeight:)` latest height must be provided so that minedHeight
  can be compared with the lastest and the `defaultStaleTolerance` constant.

- `TransactionRecipient` is now a public type.

- `ZcashTransaction.Output` can be queried to know the inner details of a
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview`. It will return an array with all the tracked
  outputs for that transaction so that they can be shown to users who request them

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.State` is introduced to represent `confirmed`,
  `pending` or `expired` states. This State is relative to the current height
  of the chain that is passed to the function `getState(for currentHeight: BlockHeight)`.

State should be a transient value and it's not adviced to store it unless
transactions have stale values such as `confirmed` or `expired`.

### Synchronizer Changes

- `public func getTransactionOutputs(transaction) async -> [ZcashTransaction.Output]` is added to
get the outputs related to the given transaction. You can use this to know every detail of the
transaction Overview and show it in a more fine-grained UI.

- `TransactionRecipient` is returned on `getRecipients(for:)`.

## Renamed

- `AccountEntity` called `Account` is now `DbAccount`

## Removed

- `ZcashTransaction.Received` and `ZcashTransaction.Sent` are removed
  and replaced by `Overview` since the notion of Sent and received is
  not entirely applicable to Zcash transactions where value can be
  sent and received at the same time. Transactions with negative value
  will be considered as "sent" but that won't be enforced with a type
  anymore
- `cancelSpend()`: support for cancel spend was removed since its
  completion was not guaranteed
- `PendingTransactionEntity` and all of its related components.
  Pending items are still tracked and visualized by the existing APIs
  but they are retrieved from the `TransactionRepository` instead by
  returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` instead.
- `pendingDbURL` is removed from every place it was required. Its
  deletion is responsibility of wallet developers.
- `ClearedTransactions` are now just `transactions`.`MigrationManager`
  is deleted. Now all migrations are in charge of the rust welding layer.
- `PendingTransactionDao.swift` is removed.
- `PendingTransactionRepository` protocol is removed.
- `TransactionManagerError`
- `PersistentTransactionManager`
- `OutboundTransactionManager` is deleted and replaced by `TransactionEncoder`
  which now incorporates `submit(encoded:)` functionality
- `DatabaseMigrationManager` is remove since it's no longer needed all Database
  migrations shall be hanlded by the rust layer.
- `ZcashSDK.defaultPendingDbName` along with any sibling members
- `TransactionRepository`
    - `findMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received)`
    - `findMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent)`

### [#1013] Enable more granular control over logging behavior

Now the SDK allows for more fine-tuning of its logging behavior. The `LoggingPolicy` enum
provides for three options: `.default(OSLogger.LogLevel)` wherein the SDK will use its own logger, with the option
to customize the log level by passing an `OSLogger.LogLevel` to the enum case.
`custom` allows one to pass a custom `Logger` implementation for completely customized logging.
Lastly, `noLogging` disables logging entirely.

To utilize this new configuration option, pass a `loggingPolicy` into the `Initializer`. If unspecified, the SDK
will utilize an internal `Logger` implementation with an `OSLogger.LogLevel` of `.debug`

### [#442] Implement parallel downloading and scanning

The SDK now parallelizes the download and scanning of blocks. If the network connection of the client device is fast enough then the scanning
process doesn't have to wait for blocks to be downloaded. This makes the whole sync process faster.

`Synchronizer.stop()` method is not async anymore.

### [#361] Redesign errors inside the SDK

Now the SDK uses only one error type - `ZcashError`. Each method that throws now throws only `ZcashError`.
Each publisher (or stream) that can emit error now emitts only `ZcashError`.

Each symbol in `ZcashError` enum represents one error. Each error is used only in one place
inside the SDK. Each error has assigned unique error code (`ZcashErrorCode`) which can be used in logs.

### [#969] Clear cache on error to avoid discontinuities when verifying
This change drops the file-system cache whenever an error occurs when storing blocks
so that there is not a discontinuity in the cached block range that could cause a
discontinuity error on libzcashlc when calling `scan_blocks`. This will have a setback of
at most 100 blocks that would have to be re-downloaded when resuming sync.

### [#959] and [#914] Value of outbound transactions does not match user intended tx input

This change switches to a new (future) version of the rust crates that will get
rid of the sent and received transactions Views in favor of a v_transaction
view that will do better accounting of outgoing and incoming funds.
Additionally it will support an outputs view for seeing the inner details of
transactions enabling the SDKs tell the users the precise movement of value
that a tx causes in its multiple possible ways according to the protocol.

the v_tx_outputs view is not yet implemented.

Sent and Received transaction sub-types are kept for compatibility purposes but
they are generated from Overviews instead of queried from a specific view.

In the transaction Overview the value represents the whole value transfer for
the transaction from the point of view of a given account including fees. This
means that the value for a single transaction Overview struct represents the
addition or subtraction of ZEC value to the account's balance.

Future updates will give clients the possibility to drill into the inner
workings of those value changes in a per-output basis for each transaction.

Also, the field pending_unmined field was added to v_transactions so that
wallets can query DataDb for pending but yet unmined txs

This will prepare the field for removing the notion of a "PendingDb" and its nuances.

### [#888] Updates to layer between Swift and Rust

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

`KeyDeriving` protocol is changed. And therefore `DerivationTool` is changed. `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed:accountIndex:)` and
`deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from:)` methods are now async. `DerivationTool` offers alternatives for these methods. Alternatives are using either
closures or Combine.

### [#469] ZcashRustBackendWelding to Async

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

These methods previously returned Optional and now those methods return non-optional value and those methods can an throw error:
- `getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> SaplingAddress`
- `func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> UnifiedAddress`
- `func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> TransparentAddress`

These methods are now async:
- `func getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`
- `func getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`

`Initializer` no longer have methods to get balance. Use `SDKSynchronizer` (or it's alternative APIs) to get balance.

- `func getVerifiedBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
  use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an

  Use `getReceivedMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead
- `func getSentMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
  Use `getSentMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead

## Changed

### [#209] Support Initializer Aliases

Added `ZcashSynchronizerAlias` enum which is used to identify an instance of the `SDKSynchronizer`. All the paths
to all resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are updated automatically inside the SDK according to the
alias. So it's safe to create multiple instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`. Each instance must have unique Alias. If
the `default` alias is used then the SDK works the same as before this change was introduced.

The SDK now also checks which aliases are used and it prevents situations when two instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`
has the same alias. Methods `prepare()` and `wipe()` do checks for used alias. And those methods fail
with `InitializerError.aliasAlreadyInUse` if the alias is already used.

If the alias check fails in the `prepare()` method then the status of the `SDKSynchronizer` isn't switched from `unprepared`.
These methods newly throw `SynchronizerError.notPrepared` error when the status is `unprepared`:
- `sendToAddress(spendingKey:zatoshi:toAddress:memo:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `shieldFundsspendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `latestUTXOs(address:) async throws -> [UnspentTransactionOutputEntity]`
- `refreshUTXOs(address:from:) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
- `rewind(policy:) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error>`

Provided file URLs to resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are now parsed inside the SDK and updated
according to the alias. If some error during this happens then `SDKSynchronzer.prepare()` method throws
`InitializerError.cantUpdateURLWithAlias` error.

### [#831] Add support for alternative APIs

There are two new protocols (`ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer`). And there are two new
objects which conform to respective protocols (`ClosureSDKSynchronizer` and `CombineSDKSynchronizer`). These
new objects offer alternative API for the `SDKSynchronizer`. Now the client app can choose which technology
it wants to use to communicate with Zcash SDK and it isn't forced to use async.

These methods in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `prepare(with:viewingKeys:walletBirthday:)`
- `start(retry:)`
- `stop()`
- `cancelSpend(transaction:)`
- All the variants of the `getMemos(for:)` method.
- All the variants fo the `getRecipients(for:)` method.
- `allConfirmedTransactions(from:limit:)`

These properties in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `pendingTransactions`
- `clearedTransactions`
- `sentTransactions`
- `receivedTransactions`

Non async `SDKsynchronizer.latestHeight(result:)` were moved to `ClosureSDKSynchronizer`.

### [#724] Switch from event based notifications to state based notifications

The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers. Check the migrating document and
documentation in the code to get more information.

### [#826] Change how the SDK is initialized

- `viewingKeys` and `walletBirthday` are removed from `Initializer` constuctor. These parameters moved to
  `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` function.
- Constructor of the `SDKSynchronizer` no longer throws exception.
- Any value emitted from `lastState` stream before `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` is called has `latestScannedHeight` set to 0.
- `Initializer.initialize` function isn't public anymore. To initialize SDK call `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` instead.

### [#821] `failedToWriteMetadata` at sync startup

No public API changes.

Adds `func shouldClearBlockCacheAndUpdateInternalState() -> BlockHeight?` to `SyncRanges`
so that the compact block processor can advert internal states that are not consistent and
recover from such state.

For concrete examples check out the tests in:
`Tests/NetworkTests/CompactBlockProcessorTests.swift`

## Deleted
Removed linter binary from repository

# 0.19.0-beta

### [#816] Improve how rewind call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.rewind(policy:)` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the rewind is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#801] Improve how wipe call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.wipe()` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the wipe is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#793] Send synchronizerStopped notification only when sync process stops

`synchronizerStopped` notification is now sent after the sync process stops. It's
not sent right when `stop()` method is called.

### [#795] Include sapling-spend file into bundle for tests

This is only an internal change and doesn't change the behavior of the SDK. `Initializer`'s
constructor has a new parameter `saplingParamsSourceURL`. Use `SaplingParamsSourceURL.default`
value for this parameter.

### [#764] Refactor communication between components inside th SDK

This is mostly an internal change. A consequence of this change is that all the notifications
delivered via `NotificationCenter` with the prefix `blockProcessor` are now gone. If affected
notifications were used in your code use notifications with the prefix `synchronizer` now.
These notifications are defined in `SDKSynchronizer.swift`.

### [#759] Remove Jazz-generated HTML docs

We remove these documents since they are outdated and we rely on the docs in the code itself.

### [#726] Modularize GRPC layer

This is mostly internal change. `LightWalletService` is no longer public. If it
is used in your code replace it by using `SDKSynchronizer` API.

### [#770] Update GRPC swift library
This updates to GRPC-Swift 1.14.0.

## File system backed block cache

File system based block cache. Compact blocks will now be stored
on the file system. Caller must provide a `URL` pointing to the
filesystem root directory where the fsBlock cache is. this directory
is expected to contain a `/blocks` sub-directory with the blocks stored
in the convened filename format `{height}-{hash}-compactblock`. This directory
must be granted both read and write permissions.

the file system cache will have a "bookkeeping" database that the rust
welding layer will use to know the state of the cache and locate the
cached compact blocks. This directory can be deleted provided that the
Compactblock processor or Synchronizer are not running. Upon deletion
caller is responsible for initializing these objects for the cache to
be created.

Implementation notes: Users of the SDK will know the path they will
provide but must assume no behavior whatsoever or rely on the cached
information in any way, since it is an internal state of the SDK.
Maintainers might provide no support for problems related to speculative
use of the file system cache. If you consider your application needs any
other information than the one available through public APIs, please
file the corresponding feature request.

### Added

- `Synchronizer.shieldFunds(spendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold)` shieldingThreshold
was added allowing wallets to manage their own shielding policies.

### Removed
- `InitializerError.cacheDbMigrationFailed`

### Deprecations
CacheDb references that were deprecated instead of **deleted** are pointing out
that they should be useful for you to migrate from using cacheDb.

- `ResourceProvider.cacheDbURL` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

- `NetworkConstants.defaultCacheDbName` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

## Bugfixes

### [#645] Default rewind after ReOrg is 20 blocks when it should be 10
This fixes an issue where the default reorg was 20 blocks rewind instead of 10. The
reorg count was incremented before calling the rewind height computing function.

## Use Librustzcash database views to query and represent transactions

### [#556] Change data structures which represent transactions.

These data types are gone: `Transaction`, `TransactionEntity`, `ConfirmedTransaction`,
`ConfirmedTransactionEntity`. And these data types were added: `ZcashTransaction.Overview`,
`ZcashTransaction.Received`, `ZcashTransaction.Sent`.

New data structures are very similar to the old ones. Although there many breaking changes.
The APIs of the `SDKSynchronizer` remain unchanged in their behavior. They return different
data types. **When adopting this change, you should check which data types are used by methods
of the `SDKSynchronizer` in your code and change them accordingly.**

New transaction structures no longer have a `memo` property. This responds to the fact that
Zcash transactions can have either none or multiple memos. To get memos for the transaction
the `SDKSynchronizer` has now new methods to fetch those:
- `func getMemos(for transaction: ZcashTransaction.Overview) throws -> [Memo]`,
- `func getMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received) throws -> [Memo]`
- `func getMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent) throws -> [Memo]`

## CompactBlockProcessor is now internal
### [#671] Make CompactBlockProcessor Internal.

The CompactBlockProcessor is no longer a public class/API. Any direct access will
end up as a compiler error. Recommended way how to handle things is via `SDKSynchronizer`
from now on. The Demo app has been updated accordingly as well.

## We've changed how we download and scan blocks. Status reporting has changed.

### [#657] Change how blocks are downloaded and scanned.

In previous versions, the SDK first downloaded all the blocks and then it
scanned all the blocks. This approach requires a lot of disk space. The SDK now
behaves differently. It downloads a batch of blocks (100 by default), scans those, and
removes those blocks from the disk. And repeats this until all the blocks are processed.

`SyncStatus` was changed. `.downloading`, `.validating`, and `.scanning` symbols
were removed. And the `.scanning` symbol was added. The removed phases of the sync
process are now reported as one phase.

Notifications were also changed similarly. These notifications were
removed: `SDKSynchronizerDownloading`, `SDKSyncronizerValidating`, and `SDKSyncronizerScanning`.
And the `SDKSynchronizerSyncing` notification was added. The added notification replaces
the removed notifications.

## New Wipe Method to delete wallet information. Use with care.

### [#677] Add support for wallet wipe into SDK. Add new method `Synchronizer.wipe()`.

## Benchmarking APIs: A primer

### [#663] Foundations for the benchmarking/performance testing in the SDK.

This change presents 2 building blocks for the future automated tests, consisting
of a new SDKMetrics interface to control flow of the data in the SDK and
new performance (unit) test measuring synchronization of 100 mainnet blocks.

# 0.17.4-beta

### [#665] Fix testShieldFunds() `get_transparent_balance` error
updates `libzcashlc` to `0.1.1` to fix an error where getting a
transparent balance on an empty database would fail.

# 0.17.3-beta

### [#646] SDK sync process resumes to previously saved block height
This change adds an internal storage test on UserDefaults that tells the
SDK where sync was left off when cancelled whatever the reason for it
to restart on a later attempt. This fixes some issues around syncing
long block ranges in several attempts not enhancing the right transactions
because the enhancing phase would only consider the last range scanned.
This only fixes the situation where rewinding the SDK would cause the
whole database to be cleared instead and syncing to be restarted from
scratch (issue [#660]).

- commit `3b7202c` Fix `testShieldFunds()` dataset loading issue. (#659)

- [#532] [0.16.x-beta] Download does not stop correctly

  Issue Reported:

  When the synchronizer is stopped, the processor does not cancel
  the download correctly. Then when attempting to resume sync, the
  synchronizer is not on `.stopped` and can't be resumed

  this doesn't appear to happen in `master` branch that uses
  structured concurrency for operations.

  Fix:

  This commit makes sure that the download streamer checks cancelation
  before processing any block, or getting called back to report progress
