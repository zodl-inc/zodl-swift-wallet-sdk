# Unreleased

Changes are relative to `2.7.0`.

## Changed

- `Broadcaster` submits to several endpoints at once. Breaking; see `MIGRATING.md`.
  - `createProposedTransactions` / `createTransactionFromPCZT` return `[CreatedTransaction]`, with
    non-optional `raw` bytes, instead of `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]`.
    `CreatedTransaction(overview:)` rebuilds one from a stored overview.
  - `submit(_ rawTransaction: Data, to: LightWalletEndpoint)` is replaced by
    `submit(transaction:to:timing:)`, which submits to every supplied endpoint in parallel — first
    acceptance wins, the rest get a grace window — and returns a `TransactionSubmissionOutcome`
    instead of throwing. `submit(transactions:to:timing:)` submits a batch sequentially, stopping at
    the first transaction that is not accepted.
  - The endpoints are recorded as the transaction's retry plan: background resubmission retries
    through them rather than the synchronizer's default endpoint, and never auto-submits a
    `Broadcaster`-created transaction the app has not submitted itself. Plans survive a reorg and are
    deleted by `Synchronizer.wipe()`.
  - The plan is recorded before any network attempt, so `.cancelled` and `.timedOut` both mean
    "outcome unknown", not "not sent".
  - With Tor enabled, each endpoint submission uses an isolated Tor client.
- `Initializer.InitializationResult` gained `.seedNotRelevant`, returned by `Initializer.initialize`
  and `Synchronizer.prepare` when the wallet database belongs to a different seed; it was previously
  indistinguishable from `.success`. Exhaustive switches must handle it — treat it as you treat
  `.seedRequired`. See `MIGRATING.md`.
- `prepare(with:walletBirthday:name:keySource:)` no longer takes a `WalletInitMode`, and that enum is
  removed: the SDK derives new-versus-restore from the wallet state and the now-optional birthday.
  Drop the argument. See `MIGRATING.md`.
- `Synchronizer.allTransactions()` is now a protocol requirement. `SDKSynchronizer` already
  implements it; a type conforming to `Synchronizer` directly must supply it.
- `ZcashError.rustSetTransactionStatus` is `ZRUST0107`, not `ZRUST0111`. `ZRUST0111` is now
  `rustMigrationTakeBroadcastTransaction`, so anything matching on the code string must be
  re-pointed.
- A new wallet takes its birthday from a recent lightwalletd tree state below the reorg horizon
  rather than the bundled checkpoint, cutting first-launch scanning while remaining reorg-safe. It
  falls back to the bundled checkpoint when the server is unreachable.
- Read-only calls no longer serialize behind writes: wallet getters, balances, memos, the `propose*`
  family and the migration status and progress reads answer while a proof is being generated. A
  just-mined broadcast can trail the migration reads by at most one write-lane pass.
- Wallet-database connections set a SQLite busy timeout, so contention with a concurrent writer
  surfaces as a bounded wait rather than an immediate `database is locked`.
- `proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration(accountUUID:)` remains, but sweeps only what fits in one
  transaction and cannot migrate a realistic Orchard balance; new integrations should drive the
  migration group below.
- Updated `zcash_client_sqlite` to 0.22.0-rc.8 and `pczt` to 0.9.3.

## Fixed

- Transactions created from proposals and from finalized PCZTs are returned for broadcast from the
  wallet store instead of being reconstructed from `v_transactions`, so sends and transparent-fund
  shielding no longer fail with `ZTREE0001 transactionRepositoryEntityNotFound` when that view has
  not projected the stored row yet. Failure to read the required bytes reports `ZRUST0150
  rustGetTransaction` with the affected transaction id.
- Fetching transactions no longer fails on wallets whose `trust_status` column is NULL — which is
  every wallet today, since transaction trust is an opt-in marker with no default. The strict decode
  threw on the first row, so `getAllTransactions` returned an empty list over a fully-populated
  wallet; a NULL now decodes as untrusted.
- `SimpleConnectionProvider`'s lazy connection init is lock-guarded: two concurrent first-touch reads
  could construct two SQLite connections and silently drop one.
- `ZcashRustBackend.decryptAndStoreTransaction` read the FFI's -1 error sentinel as success, so a
  failed decrypt-and-store returned an all-zero txid rather than throwing
  `ZcashError.rustDecryptAndStoreTransaction`. Enhancement, the mempool monitor and
  `enhanceTransactionBy` took those failures for completed work, losing memos and transparent history
  with no error and no retry.
- The note-commitment-witness repair check now runs on the launches it should. It compared app
  versions as strings (so 2.9.0 → 2.10.0 read as a downgrade), kept one marker for every synchronizer
  alias, wrote that marker before running the repair, read a missing `CFBundleShortVersionString` as
  version `""`, and never moved the marker back after a rollback — each of which could skip the
  repair indefinitely. Existing installs run the check once more on the next launch.
- Server-streaming gRPC calls (UTXO fetch, subtree roots, transparent-address transactions, block
  ranges) use the endpoint's streaming-call timeout rather than its single-call timeout, fixing
  spurious `[ZUTXO0001] Awaiting transactions from the stream failed` on long streams.
- Tor-layer errors (`rustTorConnectToLightwalletd`, `rustTorLwdGetInfo`, `rustTorLwdSubmit`,
  `rustTorLwdFetchTransaction`, `rustTorLwdLatestBlockHeight`, `rustTorLwdGetTreeState`) are
  retryable service errors. They previously bypassed the retry path into a fatal sync failure, so a
  transient Tor circuit problem needed an app restart to clear.
- `createProposedTransactions` and `createTransactionFromPCZT` no longer emit
  `TransactionSubmitResult.submitFailure` for a transaction the server already has: on a non-zero
  submit error code the SDK asks the same lightwalletd whether the txid is in mempool or chain and
  emits `.success` if it is.
- An unmined sent transaction whose expiry height has passed is reported as `.expired` even when the
  database's `expired_unmined` flag has not been updated; such sends previously stayed `.pending`
  indefinitely.
- Transaction enhancement retries the write that follows a successful fetch, so a transient write
  failure no longer leaves a transaction un-enhanced after one attempt.
- Background resubmission no longer re-broadcasts a freshly submitted transaction during a session's
  first sync cycle; its five-minute throttle applies from the first invocation.
- Tearing down a lightwalletd connection releases its event-loop threads. Each ephemeral connection
  previously leaked a thread for the lifetime of the process.
- `getAccountsBalances()` no longer reports empty balances for up to ~30 s after a restore completes,
  which briefly zeroed the restored funds and any migration eligibility derived from them.
- A malformed or hostile lightwalletd subtree-roots response no longer crashes the process on an
  out-of-range `completingBlockHeight`, and a stalled Ironwood subtree-roots stream is retried like
  the Sapling and Orchard streams instead of adding the full streaming deadline to every sync pass.
- Memos on Ironwood outputs are retrievable; a note id in the Ironwood pool was rejected as an
  unrecognized shielded protocol.

## Added

### Wallet initialization

- `ZcashError.initializerSeedMismatch` (`ZINIT0006`): `Synchronizer.prepare` and
  `Initializer.initialize` validate the supplied seed against the wallet's seed-derived accounts and
  throw rather than open a wallet the seed cannot spend from. Restoring a different wallet requires
  `wipe()` first. Wallets whose only accounts are imported (hardware-wallet UFVKs) are exempt. See
  `MIGRATING.md`.

### Custom (regtest-style) networks

- `NetworkType.regtest`: an exhaustive `switch` over `NetworkType` stops compiling until the case is
  handled.
- `NetworkActivationHeights` (per-upgrade heights `sapling` through `nu6_3`, plus
  `.allActiveFromGenesis`), `ZcashNetworkBuilder.regtest(activationHeights:)`,
  `ZcashNetworkBuilder.custom(base:activationHeights:)`, and `ZcashSDKRegtestConstants`.
- `ZcashNetwork.saplingActivationHeight`, `.customActivationHeights`, and `.customNetworkBase`.
  Default implementations keep existing `ZcashNetwork` conformers source-compatible.
- A custom network skips the chain-name and consensus-branch-id server checks, in sync validation and
  in `evaluateBestOf(endpoints:)`; the Sapling-activation-height check still applies. Registration is
  process-global and ordering-sensitive — see `MIGRATING.md`.

### Transaction submission

- `CreatedTransaction`, `SubmissionTiming`, `TransactionSubmissionOutcome` and
  `TransactionSubmissionReport`, the value types of the reworked `Broadcaster` API.
- `timing`-less overloads of `Broadcaster.submit(transaction:to:)` and
  `Broadcaster.submit(transactions:to:)`, defaulting to `SubmissionTiming.default`.
- `LightWalletEndpoint` conforms to `Equatable`.

### Balances and proposals

- `PoolBalance.lockedValue`: value held by an output lock, excluded from `spendableValue` but still
  owned by the account and counted in `PoolBalance.total()`.
- `AccountBalance.shieldedSpendableValue`, `.shieldedTotal()`, `.shieldedChangePendingConfirmation`
  and `.shieldedValuePendingSpendability`: sums over every shielded pool, so call sites need not
  hand-sum pools and pick up future pools automatically.
- `ZcashNetwork.ironwoodActivationHeight`.
- `Proposal.spendsLegacyOrchardFunds`, whether the proposal spends notes from the legacy Orchard
  pool, so a wallet can warn before a turnstile-crossing send.
  `Proposal.testOnlyFakeProposal(totalFee:spendsLegacyOrchardFunds:)` gained a defaulted parameter
  for building test fixtures.

### Orchard → Ironwood migration

A 37-member group on the `Synchronizer` protocol, account-scoped by `AccountUUID`, so two accounts
can migrate concurrently. Its members work without `prepare()`, so a background session can deliver a
transfer without starting sync. `ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer` do not mirror it.

- Value types: `MigrationAdvanceStep`, `MigrationAdvance` (with `MigrationNextWork` and
  `MigrationStepKind`), `MigrationBroadcastInstruction`, `MigrationProveTarget`,
  `MigrationProveOutcome`, `MigrationProgress`, `MigrationSchedule`, `MigrationTransferProposal`,
  `MigrationTransferResult`, `MigrationRunEstimate` (with `MigrationRunEstimate.Run`),
  `MigrationSyncWakeup`, `MigrationPreparationStep`, `MigrationSigningBudget`, `NoteSplitProposal`,
  `PreparedMigrationTransfer`, `MigrationUnsignedTransferPczt`, `MigrationSignedTransferPczt`,
  `MigrationTransactionStatus` (with `MigrationInvalidReason`), `ImmediateMigrationProposal`,
  `KeystoneBatchDecodeResult` and `KeystoneFirmwareVersion`. Migration transaction ids are `UInt32`.
  The preparation-handoff members carry txids as raw byte-order `Data` (matching `TxId.id`, not the
  reversed display-hex order produced by `Data.toHexStringTxId()`), and
  `MigrationTransferResult.success(txId:)` carries the display-hex string.
- Drive: `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` returns `nil` when no run is stored, otherwise a
  `MigrationAdvance` whose `.step` is `.requiresAttention(id:)`, `.prove(transactions:)`,
  `.broadcast(_:)`, `.rebuild(id:)`, `.waiting`, or the per-run terminal `.complete` — never
  "nothing left to migrate", which is what `proposeMigrationTransfers` answers. A driver switches
  over `.step` and hands each actionable arm's payload to its executor:
  `proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)`,
  `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)`, or
  `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)`. The executors decide nothing themselves; every
  repair happens inside the drive.
- `MigrationAdvance.next` is an advisory outlook: the kind of the migration's next serviceable work
  and the earliest height it becomes serviceable at, assuming the returned step is executed, or `nil`
  when nothing is height-schedulable. A `.broadcast` outlook needs no sync session; a `.prove` one is
  sync-bound. `nextMigrationWake(accountUUID:)` re-reads the retained outlook of the most recent
  crank by any caller, without cranking again; it is a floor, superseded by the next crank, including
  to `nil`.
- A `.prove` step carries the whole provable set, earliest-ready first and never empty, and that
  batch is the instruction the prove executor takes. `MigrationProveTarget.isScheduleDue` marks a
  transaction whose broadcast window has already arrived, so its missing proof is what blocks
  delivery now. `maxProofs` bounds a background session's proving CPU; skips do not spend it. Proofs
  are produced one per database-actor turn, and proving threads run at utility QoS on Apple
  platforms, so an interactive read waits at most one proof rather than the whole sweep.
- Preparations are submitted by the app, the ordinary way.
  `proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)` returns a `MigrationProveOutcome` carrying
  `preparationTxids`, and `takeMigrationPreparation(accountUUID:byTxid:)` hands each one back as a
  `PreparedMigrationTransfer`, binding the wallet's record in the same database transaction, so a
  consumer that crashed before submitting re-retrieves the same bytes over the same record. Submit
  the bytes through your ordinary raw-transaction path, then close the loop with
  `recordMigrationPreparationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:result:)`. Both members are preparation-gated: a
  transfer's id is refused, because transfers are served by the drive's broadcast instruction alone.
  Only acceptances need recording. A retrieved-but-unsubmitted preparation expires and resurfaces
  through the attention path; a submitted-but-unrecorded one is promoted when scanning sees it mine.
- `MigrationBroadcastInstruction` and `MigrationProveTarget` have no importable initializers, so
  holding one is the proof that the caller cranked and un-instructed proving or broadcasting does not
  compile. Test targets can construct genuine instructions through `@_spi(Testing) import
  ZcashLightClientKit`. A stale instruction throws `rustMigrationTakeBroadcastTransaction` from the
  broadcast seam; discharge it by cranking again, not by retrying the executor.
- Planning and delivery: `proposeMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` proposes a randomized-cadence
  schedule, `signAndStoreMigrationSchedule` commits it, `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)` gives
  the minimal sync-and-prove wake-up schedule (heights, and the transfer ids each covers), and
  `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)` delivers in a session that does not sync.
  Broadcast never proves: a due row still awaiting its proof appears in the next `.prove` batch with
  `isScheduleDue` set. A submit rejection identifying the transaction as already known is recorded as
  success. Proving marks a transaction's inputs spent, so the wallet's own sends cannot double-spend
  a scheduled transfer's inputs during the window between proving and broadcast, and the anchors a
  run depends on are marked durable in the wallet database at open, so a run longer than the
  database's own history-pruning margin does not stall.
- `estimatedMigrationChainTip()` and `estimatedMigrationSecondsPerBlock()` project a wall-clock chain
  tip from the measured block rate (a window of the last 100 scanned blocks, a 5–150 s clamp, a 75 s
  fallback below two samples). They are wallet-scoped and take no account.
  `hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:useEstimatedTip:)` lets that estimate only *accelerate*
  scheduled-height due-ness — expiry always evaluates against the scanned tip, and an estimator
  failure degrades silently to scanned-tip behaviour. A one-argument overload defaults it to `false`;
  `migrationAdvanceStep` always applies the estimate and takes no parameter for it. Mined-ness is
  derived rather than reported, and judged at the wallet's fully-scanned height.
- Status: `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)` returns the per-transaction rows behind
  `migrationProgress`'s summary — kind, lifecycle state, scheduled and expiry heights, readiness,
  `NextAction` or `Blocker`, `dependsOn`, and `anchorBoundaryHeight` (`nil` for a preparation) — keyed
  by a stable id. An empty array means no stored run, not an error. `Blocker.invalid` carries a
  `MigrationInvalidReason`: input-spend marks become `.fundingSpent`, other unsatisfiable causes
  `.rejectedInvalid`, and new expiry decisions use `Blocker.expired`. Chain inclusion outranks both.
  `Array<MigrationTransactionStatus>.isPreparationPhaseComplete` is `true` iff every
  preparation-kind row is mined, vacuously so when the run needs no preparations.
  `hasInvalidMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` answers the same question in one call.
- Recovery: `restartCurrentMigrationStep` cancels the stored run — releasing every note reservation
  its never-broadcast transactions held, so the fresh plan sees the full balance at once — and
  re-plans. `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` rebuilds every expired transfer of the
  stored run, all-or-nothing, with `usk` selecting in-process signing or the external-signer lane. A
  funding note spent outside the migration throws, naming `restartCurrentMigrationStep` as the
  remedy.
- Note split: `isNoteSplitNeeded(accountUUID:)`, `prepareNoteSplit(accountUUID:)` and
  `submitNoteSplit(accountUUID:proposal:usk:options:)`, which signs the run and serves the first
  note-split transaction back through the same atomic broadcast seam the delivery step uses.
- External signer: `createUnsignedNoteSplitPCZTs` / `storeSignedNoteSplitPCZTs` and
  `createUnsignedMigrationTransferPCZTs` / `storeSignedMigrationSchedulePCZTs`. All are plural: a run
  has N preparation transactions, and one signing ceremony covers them together.
- Keystone batch signing: `buildKeystoneSignBatchQRParts(requestId:pczts:maxFragmentLen:)`,
  `resetKeystoneSignBatchDecoder()`, `decodeKeystoneSignBatchPart(_:expectedRequestId:)` and
  `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:)`. Retain your own unredacted PCZTs and pass
  them back in the same order — signatures align by position. A completed scan is the only place the
  device's `KeystoneFirmwareVersion` is reported; a request-id mismatch throws.
  `batchMigrationPcztsForSigning(_:maxActionsPerSession:)` splits an ordered unsigned-PCZT batch into
  signer sessions bounded by an action budget (`MigrationSigningBudget.keystone` is 96, `.default`
  512), preserving order.
- Residual and estimation: `lockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:)` locks every spendable legacy-Orchard
  note until explicit unlock and returns the total locked; `unlockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:)`
  returns the number of locks cleared; `residualAfterMigration(accountUUID:)` and
  `estimateMigrationRuns(accountUUID:)` return what a multi-round UI needs. Each
  `MigrationRunEstimate.Run` carries `actions` (16 per preparation transaction, 3 per transfer) and
  `keystoneSigningSessions`, summed as `totalActions` / `totalKeystoneSigningSessions`. Migrating a
  locked residual anyway is `unlockMigrationResidual` then `proposeImmediateMigration`, in that
  order, since locked notes are excluded from selection.
- Immediate sweep: `proposeImmediateMigration(accountUUID:)` returns an `ImmediateMigrationProposal`
  (a `Proposal` plus its decoded `amount` and `fee`) and executes through the ordinary
  `createProposedTransactions` / `createPCZTFromProposal` pipeline. Record the broadcast with
  `recordImmediateMigration(accountUUID:txid:)` so `migrationProgress(accountUUID:)` reports it; once
  it mines, `migrationProgress` reports `nil` again rather than a terminal snapshot.
  `MigrationProgress.isImmediate` distinguishes it from an engine-tracked run. The immediate lane
  creates no run, so `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` stays `nil` throughout.
- Privacy and cost contract to build confirmation UI around: broadcasts go over a dedicated Tor
  runtime, independent of the global `tor(enabled:)` toggle, and fail closed — Tor requested but
  unavailable throws `ZcashError.migrationTorUnavailable`, never a silent clearnet fallback.
  `MigrationNetworkPrivacyOptions.submissionEndpoint` is required: exactly one server per attempt,
  chosen by the host, and confirmation comes from block scanning rather than txid polling. The sync
  gate imposes exactly one hold — `start()` throws `ZcashError.migrationSyncBlocked` while a
  submission is in flight, ordinarily seconds. Nothing else holds sync: not elapsed time since a
  broadcast, and not pending work. See `isMigrationSyncBlocked()` and `migrationSyncBlockedStream`.
  The broadcasting members throw `ZcashError.migrationBroadcastDuringSync` while a sync runs, and a
  record failure after a successful broadcast throws the distinguishable
  `ZcashError.migrationRecordFailedAfterBroadcast`, which a later execution window heals.
- Persisting the committed schedule is the host's responsibility; the SDK keeps no copy.
  `MigrationSchedule.preparations` carries the note-preparation transactions the transfer rows do not
  surface, decoding as an empty array from a copy persisted before the field existed. Its
  `encode(to:)` omits `proposalHandle`, a process-lifetime plan-cache key, so every decoded copy
  carries handle `0` — re-propose rather than commit a persisted schedule.
- New `ZcashError` cases: `ZRUST0099`–`ZRUST0108`, `ZRUST0113`, `ZRUST0115`–`ZRUST0122`,
  `ZRUST0124`–`ZRUST0138`, `ZRUST0140`–`ZRUST0147` and `ZRUST0149`–`ZRUST0150`.

### Slipstream sync engine

- `SlipstreamSynchronizer`, an alternative `Synchronizer` implementation with non-linear
  Spend-before-Sync scheduling, concurrent density-adaptive fetch, per-call Tor policy with server
  failover, and a stall watchdog. Hosts opt in by constructing it; `SDKSynchronizer` remains the
  default. It implements the migration group above with the same session separation, honors the
  `Synchronizer.wipe()` contract (the submit-plan database file is deleted with the rest), and
  drives background transaction resubmission from its poll loop: unmined, unexpired transactions
  are re-broadcast through their recorded submit plans and expired plans are pruned, matching
  `SDKSynchronizer`. Error codes `ZRUST0093`–`ZRUST0097`.
- `SynchronizerState.isRecovering`.
- During a restore with NU6.3 active, the collapsed balance reported while recovering lands in
  the Ironwood pool rather than in Orchard, so a host gating a migration prompt on a nonzero
  Orchard balance is not prompted on a guess. Totals are unchanged.

# 2.7.0 - 2026-08-28

## Added
- Ironwood (NU6.3) receive, sync, and send support. Once NU6.3 activates,
  payments to Orchard receivers are delivered through Ironwood bundles in
  version 6 transactions. `AccountBalance.ironwoodBalance` reports the
  Ironwood balance, `ZcashTransaction.Output.Pool.ironwood` identifies Ironwood
  outputs, and `Proposal` reports Ironwood payments and change.
- `Synchronizer.proposeOrchardToIronwoodMigration(accountUUID:)` and its closure
  and Combine adapters propose moving an account's entire Orchard balance to
  its internal Ironwood receiver after NU6.3 activation. The proposal spends
  every Orchard note, deducts the ZIP 317 fee from the transferred value, and
  leaves Sapling and transparent funds untouched. The method throws before
  NU6.3 activation.
- Server validation throws
  `ZcashError.compactBlockProcessorServerMissingIronwoodSupport` (`ZCBPEO0024`)
  when NU6.3 is active but the connected lightwalletd does not provide Ironwood
  tree state. Ironwood sync requires lightwalletd v0.4.18 or newer.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.zip318Kind` reports whether a transaction is
  `nonconforming`, `preparation`, `transfer`, `canonicalCrossingPayment`, or
  `notClassified` under ZIP 318. The value describes conformance, not
  provenance; only `preparation` and `transfer` identify this account's own
  migration. `notClassified` means the transaction predates the classification
  data, has not been decrypted, or uses an encoding unknown to this SDK; rescan
  eligible transactions before relying on the value.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.spentNoteCount` reports how many of the account's
  notes the transaction spent. `poolCrossingValue` reports the amount moved by
  a wallet-internal shielded-pool transfer, for which `value` contains only the
  negated fee. `isTrusted` reports whether the transaction's outputs become
  spendable at the trusted rather than untrusted confirmation count.

## Changed
- `proposeTransfer` and `proposefulfillingPaymentURI` now propose a ZIP 318
  canonical crossing after NU6.3 for a single canonical-denomination payment
  (`{1, 2, 5} * 10^k` from 0.01 ZEC through 10,000 ZEC) when one Orchard note
  can fund the payment and fee. The transaction uses one unpadded Ironwood
  action, reducing its ZIP 317 marginal fee by one action, but its inputs may
  require confirmations up to two ZIP 318 bucket intervals beyond the supplied
  `ConfirmationsPolicy`. Otherwise, an ordinary transaction is proposed.
- A canonical ZIP 318 crossing uses the oldest single Orchard note that covers
  the payment and fee. Ordinary note selection also now uses the oldest
  eligible notes in chain order instead of scan-discovery order.
- ZIP 318 migrations use shorter transfer and preparation delays and limit
  anchor age to four bucket boundaries instead of sixteen.
- After NU6.3, fee and change calculation charges Orchard spends and outputs as
  separate ZIP 317 actions and charges Ironwood actions against a separate
  bundle. Proposals targeting earlier heights retain the pre-NU6.3 policy.
- `addProofsToPCZT` now proves Ironwood bundles. PCZTs sent to external signers
  use the full signer view and the minimum encoding version that represents
  their content, while retaining Ironwood witness and output-metadata
  redaction.
- Transparent-address transaction enhancement now requires lightwalletd
  v0.4.18 or newer. `ZcashError.serviceGetTaddressTxidsFailed` retains its
  public shape but has updated message text.

## Removed
- The shielded voting API has been removed: `VotingRustBackend`, all public
  `Voting*` types, `PirSnapshotResolver`, `PirSnapshotProbing`, and
  `HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`. Calls using these symbols no longer compile and must
  be removed.

## Fixed
- Wallet databases upgraded by affected prerelease builds no longer fail every
  scan because of a missing ZIP 318 migration column. Production-network data
  is repaired automatically; a migration planned on a test network with a
  custom anchor grid reports `AnchorIntervalMismatch` and must be re-planned.
- ZIP 318 crossings no longer fail with `ProposalError::AnchorNotFound` when an
  anchor bucket boundary contains no note commitments. The SDK falls back to
  an ordinary crossing when no anchor can be computed.
- Hardware wallets can sign post-NU6.3 transactions whose zero-value Orchard
  padding spends previously lacked ZIP 32 derivation metadata. External signers
  that do not support compact PCZT signer views, including deployed Keystone
  firmware, can sign these transactions again.
- Ironwood notes received on an account's internal address are now classified
  as change once the funding account is known. This corrects
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview.hasChange`, note counts, and
  `ZcashTransaction.Output.isChange`; balances were unaffected. Existing data
  is repaired during migration without a rescan.
- Addresses that have received only Ironwood notes are now treated as used, so
  `getCustomUnifiedAddress(accountUUID:receivers:)` does not return them again
  and the receiving account is reported as involved in the transaction.
  Existing data is repaired during migration.
- Transparent outputs funded from Ironwood are attributed to the funding
  account and included in `getTransactionOutputs(for:)`.
- Sent transactions that cannot be observed through shielded scanning are now
  queried by transaction ID, including transactions funded entirely by
  transparent inputs whose outputs belong to another wallet. Their mined and
  expired status is updated correctly, including after a rewind.
- `SynchronizerEvent.minedTransaction` fires exactly once for each sent
  transaction's unmined-to-mined transition, including fully transparent
  transactions.
- `ZcashRustBackend.setTransactionStatus` failures are no longer ignored and
  now throw `ZcashError.rustSetTransactionStatus` (`ZRUST0111`).
- Tor-backed lightwalletd and exchange-rate requests now fail on timeout instead
  of waiting indefinitely. `TorClient.httpRequest(for:retryLimit:)` also rejects
  URL schemes other than `http` and `https`.
- `deleteAccount(_:)` no longer fails when the account is recorded as the
  recipient of one of its own sent outputs.
- Payments to the wallet's own transparent addresses report the transparent
  receiver as the output recipient instead of the account's unified address.
- `createTransactionFromPCZT(pcztWithProofs:pcztWithSigs:)` now persists
  Ironwood outputs, including recipient addresses and memos, and tags shielded
  outputs with their note commitment tree. Wallet-internal Ironwood outputs are
  therefore available from `getTransactionOutputs(for:)` before mining.

# 2.5.2 - 2026-06-03

## Changed
- Updated the Rust dependency stack to released crates.io versions
  (`orchard` 0.13.1→0.14, `zcash_client_backend` 0.22→0.23,
  `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.20.2→0.21, `zcash_keys` 0.13→0.14,
  `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs` 0.27→0.28, `zcash_protocol` 0.8→0.9,
  `zcash_address` 0.11→0.12, `zcash_transparent` 0.7→0.8, `pczt` 0.6→0.7).
  `zcash_protocol` 0.9 carries the NU6.2 activation heights (mainnet 3364600,
  testnet 4052000), so transactions targeting those heights and above are now
  built against the NU6.2 consensus branch id. The public Swift API is
  unchanged.

# 2.5.1 - 2026-05-14

## Fixed
- Fixed a bug that could cause transactions shielding more than 150 transparent
  P2PKH inputs to fail due to incorrect fee computation.

# 2.5.0 - 2026-05-11

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.rescanFrom(height:)`: Rescans the chain from the given BlockHeight.
- `SynchronizerState.fullyScannedHeight`: Contiguous-from-birthday scan high-water mark published on `stateStream`/`latestState`. Callers that need an authoritative view of the wallet's note and nullifier state at a specific height (for example, balance anchored at a poll snapshot) should gate on this rather than `latestBlockHeight` (chain tip) or `maxScannedHeight` (head-first scan progress, which can race ahead under Spend-before-Sync).
- `Synchronizer.getTreeState(height:)`: Fetches the commitment tree state at the given block height from lightwalletd and returns the protobuf-serialized `TreeState` bytes, for app-layer consumers that need to hand tree state to an external component (for example, witness generation via FFI). A throwing default implementation keeps the addition source-compatible for downstream `Synchronizer` conformers.
- `zcash_voting` dependency foundation: SDK Rust crate now depends on `zcash_voting 0.5.7` (`default-features = false`, `client-pir`, `client-tree-sync`) and exposes pure-function FFI symbols for share-nullifier computation and PIR proof validation.
- `PirSnapshotResolver`, `PirSnapshotResolverError`, `PirSnapshotProbeOutcome`, `PirSnapshotProbing`, and `HTTPPirSnapshotProbe`: Select a vote-nullifier PIR endpoint whose `/root` metadata exactly matches a voting round's expected snapshot height.
- `Voting*` Swift types: public type contract for the shielded voting FFI boundary, in `Sources/ZcashLightClientKit/Rust/Voting/VotingTypes.swift`.
- `VotingRustBackend`: Swift wrapper for the voting `libzcashlc` surface. A `final class` that owns an opaque `VotingDatabaseHandle` for the duration of a voting session. Exposes:
  - Database lifecycle: `init()`, `open(path:)`, `close()` (idempotent), and `deinit` cleanup, over `zcashlc_voting_db_open` / `zcashlc_voting_db_free`.
  - `setWalletId(_:)` over `zcashlc_voting_set_wallet_id`.
  - `precomputeDelegationPir(roundId:bundleIndex:notes:pirEndpoints:expectedSnapshotHeight:networkId:pirResolver:)` over `zcashlc_voting_precompute_delegation_pir`, with `PirSnapshotResolver`-driven endpoint selection.
  - `generateNoteWitnesses(roundId:bundleIndex:walletDbPath:notes:networkId:)` over `zcashlc_voting_generate_note_witnesses`.
  - Vote-tree sync: `syncVoteTree(roundId:nodeUrl:)`, `generateVanWitness(roundId:bundleIndex:anchorHeight:)`, and `resetTreeClient(roundId:)` over the corresponding `zcashlc_voting_sync_vote_tree` / `_generate_van_witness` / `_reset_tree_client` FFI.
  - Vote casting: `encryptShares(roundId:shares:)`, `buildVoteCommitment(roundId:bundleIndex:hotkeySeed:networkId:proposalId:choice:numOptions:vanWitness:singleShare:progress:)`, `buildSharePayloads(commitment:voteDecision:numOptions:voteCommitmentTreePosition:singleShare:)`, `markVoteSubmitted(roundId:bundleIndex:proposalId:)`, and `signCastVote(hotkeySeed:networkId:commitment:)`.
  - The static `computeShareNullifier(voteCommitment:shareIndex:primaryBlind:)` over `zcashlc_voting_compute_share_nullifier`, with 32-byte input validation.
  - `VotingRustBackendError` cases `databaseAlreadyOpen` / `databaseNotOpen` for handle-state errors, alongside the existing `rustError` and `invalidData`.
- Extends `VotingRustBackend` with additional FFI wrappers and their FFI mappings:

  Foundation helpers (static)

- `Broadcaster` protocol — separates transaction creation from submission, enabling custom broadcast strategies (e.g. submitting to multiple lightwalletd servers in parallel).
  - `Broadcaster.createProposedTransactions(proposal:spendingKey:)` — creates transactions locally without broadcasting, returning `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]` with raw bytes.
  - `Broadcaster.createTransactionFromPCZT(pcztWithProofs:pcztWithSigs:)` — extracts and stores a transaction from PCZT data without submitting.
  - `Broadcaster.submit(_:to:)` — submits raw transaction bytes to a specific `LightWalletEndpoint`. Respects Tor configuration.
- `Synchronizer.broadcaster` property, also exposed through the closure and Combine synchronizer facades, to access the `Broadcaster` from SDK synchronizer instances.
- `libzcashlc` voting tree-sync FFI: `zcashlc_voting_sync_vote_tree`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_van_witness`, and `zcashlc_voting_reset_tree_client`. Operate on the existing `VotingDatabaseHandle`, which also carries a `zcash_voting::tree_sync::VoteTreeSync` constructed in `zcashlc_voting_db_open`.
- `libzcashlc` voting wallet-notes FFI: `zcashlc_voting_get_wallet_notes`. Loads unspent Orchard notes for a wallet account at a snapshot height and returns them as a JSON-encoded `Vec<NoteInfo>`, suitable as the `notes` input to `zcashlc_voting_precompute_delegation_pir`. `account_uuid` must be a non-null pointer to exactly 16 bytes; otherwise the call fails (returns null).
- `libzcashlc` voting key-utility FFI: `zcashlc_voting_extract_orchard_fvk_from_ufvk`. Decodes a UFVK string and returns the raw 96-byte Orchard FVK. Returns null on missing Orchard component, malformed UFVK, or invalid `network_id`.
- `libzcashlc` voting utility FFI: `zcashlc_voting_warm_proving_caches`, `zcashlc_voting_decompose_weight`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_delegation_inputs`, `zcashlc_voting_generate_delegation_inputs_with_fvk`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_pczt_sighash`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_spend_auth_sig`, `zcashlc_voting_extract_nc_root`, and `zcashlc_voting_verify_witness`. These cover voting proof setup, PCZT/signature extraction, note-commitment root extraction, and witness verification.
- `libzcashlc` voting witness FFI: `zcashlc_voting_generate_note_witnesses`. Generates Orchard Merkle inclusion witnesses for a bundle's notes anchored at the round's snapshot height. Adds `incrementalmerkletree 0.8` as a direct Rust dependency.
- `libzcashlc` voting round, recovery, and delegation workflow FFI: adds C-compatible return structs and free helpers, persisted round-state APIs, crash-recovery metadata helpers, share-delegation tracking, hotkey and bundle setup, delegation PCZT/proof generation, delegation submission payloads, and VAN position persistence.
- `libzcashlc` vote-casting FFI: encrypts vote shares, builds vote commitments and share payloads, marks submitted votes, and signs cast-vote transactions.

## Changed
- Bumped Rust dependencies to current crates.io releases (`zcash_address` 0.10→0.11, `zcash_client_backend` 0.21→0.22, `zcash_client_sqlite` 0.19→0.20, `zcash_primitives`/`zcash_proofs` 0.26→0.27, `zcash_protocol` 0.7→0.8, `zcash_transparent` 0.6→0.7, `sapling-crypto` 0.6→0.7, `orchard` 0.12→0.13, `pczt` 0.5→0.6) and removed the `[patch.crates-io]` git-rev overrides. No public Swift API changes.
- Pinned `orchard` to `=0.13.1` and enabled its `unstable-voting-circuits` feature, required transitively by `zcash_voting`. No public Swift API changes.
- `SDKSyncrhonizer.importAccount` extended with `birthday: BlockHeight?`. Leaving the default `nil` value sets the chain tip, otherwise given `birthday` height is used.
- Enabled the `client-tree-sync` feature on `zcash_voting`, required by the new voting tree-sync FFI listed above.
- Added `zcash_keys 0.13` (`orchard` feature) as a Rust dependency, used by the new voting wallet-notes, key-utility, and utility FFI to decode UFVKs and derive Orchard FVKs. No public Swift API changes.
- Bumped `zcash_voting` to `0.5.7` so `network_id` matches the SDK (`0` = testnet, `1` = mainnet) end-to-end for wallet-notes JSON consumed by delegation PIR, and submitted-vote marking fails when no persisted vote row matches. No public Swift API changes.

## Fixed
- `Transport became inactive` connectivity issue.
- `NIOHTTP2` connectivity issues.

# 2.4.1 - 2025-12-03

## Added
- Custom SQL functions to `Synchronizer.debugDatabase`:
  - `txid(Blob) -> String`: converts a transaction ID from its byte form to a user-facing string.
  - `memo(Blob?) -> String?`: prints the given blob as a string if it is a text memo, and as hex-encoded bytes otherwise.

- `SDKSynchronizer.estimateTimestamp(for height: Blockheight)`: Get an estimated timestamp for a given block height.

- `SDKSynchronizer.enhanceTransactionBy(txId)` Calls an enhance action for a given txId.

## Fixed
- The Sapling parameter files download logic replaces the files atomically rather than moving them into the final destination. This prevents errors caused by partially downloaded files.

# 2.4.0 - 2025-11-10

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.getSingleUseTransparentAddress` Get an ephemeral single use transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.checkSingleUseTransparentAddresses` Checks to find any single-use ephemeral addresses exposed in the past day that have not yet received funds, excluding any whose next check time is in the future. This will then choose the address that is most overdue for checking, retrieve any UTXOs for that address over Tor, and add them to the wallet database. 
- `SDKSynchronizer.updateTransparentAddressTransactions` Finds all transactions associated with the given transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.fetchUTXOsBy(address)` Checks to find any UTXOs associated with the given transparent address. This check will cover the block range starting at the exposure height for that address, if known, or otherwise at the birthday height of the specified account.

## Fixed
- [2.3.6 change] Transparent funds are now reported after `UpdateChainTipAction` is processed. Attempt to shield before this action has been failing otherwise. Update: the solution handled only cold start of a client, now it resets the logic with each stop() call of the SDK.
- Updated to zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.9 to fix problems in transparent UTXO selection for shielding, including incorrect handling of outputs received at ephemeral addresses and selection of dust transparent outputs for shielding.

# 2.3 - 2025-08-05

## Removed
- `latencyThresholdMillis` parameter was removed from `Synchronizer.evaluateBestOf()` method. The algorithm of servers evaluation was changed to always require `kServers` to be returned.

## Updated
- `Initializer.init(..., isTorEnabled: Bool, isExchangeRateEnabled: Bool)` The initializer has been updated to include flags that control Tor setup.

## Added
- `func tor(enabled: Bool)` A function that allows clients to configure Tor usage for lwd and http calls.
- `func exchangeRateOverTor(enabled: Bool)` A function that allows clients to configure Tor usage for exchange rate.
- `func isTorSuccessfullyInitialized() async -> Bool?` A function that returns the result of the TorClient initialization. A nil value indicates that initialization has not been initiated. True/false represents success or failure, respectively.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview state` that holds information whether the transaction has been confirmed or expired or is still pending.

- An occasional error occurred after the wipe function was called due to a missing termination of the timer. The next trigger caused the compact block processor to run again, but without any database in place, resulting in a “no such table: accounts” error.

- `SDKSynchronizer.createPCZTFromProposal` Creates a partially-created (unsigned without proofs) transaction from the given proposal.
- `SDKSynchronizer.addProofsToPCZT` Adds proofs to the given PCZT
- `SDKSynchronizer.createTransactionFromPCZT` Takes a PCZT that has been separately proven and signed, finalizes it, and stores it in the wallet. Internally, this logic also submits and checks the newly stored and encoded transaction.

## Changed
- `zcashlc_propose_transfer`, `zcashlc_propose_transfer_from_uri` and `zcashlc_propose_shielding` no longer accpt a `use_zip317_fees` parameter; ZIP 317 standard fees are now always used and are not configurable.
- The SDK no longer assumes a default account. All business logic with instances of Zip32AccountIndex(<index>) has been refactored.
- `SDKSynchronizer.getAccountBalance -> AccountBalance?` into `SDKSynchronizer.getAccountsBalances -> [AccountUUID: AccountBalance]`

  instead of a fixed fee of 10,000 Zatoshi. Use `Proposal.totalFeeRequired` to check the
  total fee for a transfer before creating it.

## Added

### [#1204] Expose APIs for working with transaction proposals
New `Synchronizer` APIs that enable constructing a proposal for transferring or
shielding funds, and then creating transactions from a proposal. The intermediate
proposal can be used to determine the required fee, before committing to producing
transactions.

# 2.0.10 - 2024-02-12

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch` will perform a check to ensure that it's possible to communicate with the specified lightwalletd server, which may result in an an error. If this check fails, the user should be prompted to check the address, port and verify that the `address:port` format is respected.
- Switching endpoints causes a call to `synchronizer.Start()`, which may throw a `ZcashError`.

## Changed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
`SynchronizerState` cleaned up and changed to provide only `AccountBalance`. This struct holds `saplingBalance: PoolBalance` which represents shielded balance for both total and spendable. Also holds `unshielded: Zatoshi` which represents transparent balance.

## Removed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
- `WalletBalance` has been removed from the SDK, replaced with `AccountBalance`.
- `getTransparentBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead

# 2.0.9 - 2024-01-31

## Changed

### [#1363] Account balances in the SynchronizerState
`shieldedBalance: WalletBalance` has been replaced with `accountBalances: AccountBalance`. `AccountBalance` provides the same values as `shieldedBalance` but adds up a pending changes. Under the hood this calls rust's `getWalletSummary` which improved also the syncing initial values of % and balances.

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch`: endpoint fails, check the address, port and format address:port,
- Some `ZcashError` related to `synchronizer.Start()`: the switch calls `start()` at the end and that is the only throwing function except the validation.

# 2.0.8 - 2024-01-30

Adopt `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.5.1`. This fixes a serialization problem
broke shielding.

# 2.0.7 - 2024-01-29

## Added
- `Model.ScanSummary`
- `Model.WalletSummary.{PoolBalance, AccountBalance, WalletSummary}`

## Changed
- The `ZcashError` type has changed.
  - Added variant `rustGetWalletSummary`
  - Removed variants:
    - `rustGetVerifiedBalance` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
    - `rustGetScanProgress` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
    - `rustGetBalance` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)
- The performance of `getWalletSummary` and `scanBlocks` have been improved.

# 2.0.6 - 2024-01-28

## Changed

### [#1346] Troubleshooting synchronization
We focused on performance of the synchronization and found out a root cause in progress reporting. Simple change reduced the synchronization significantly by reporting less frequently. This affect the UX a bit because the % of the sync is updated only every 500 scanned blocks instead of every 100. Proper solution is going to be handled in #1353.

### [#1351] Recover from block stream issues
Async block stream grpc calls sometimes fail with unknown error 14, most of the times represented as `Transport became inactive` or `NIOHTTP2.StreamClosed`. Unless the service is truly down, these errors are usually false positive ones. The SDK was able to recover from this error with the next sync triggered but it takes 10-30s to happen. This delay is unnecessary so we made 2 changes. When these errors are caught the next sync is triggered immediately (at most 3 times) + the error state is not passed to the clients.

### [#1308] Enhancing seems to not process all ranges
The enhancing of the transactions now processes all the blocks suggested by scan ranges. The issue was that when new scan ranges were suggested the value that drives the enhancing range computation wasn't reset, so when higher ranges were processed, the lower ranges were skipped. This fix ensures all transaction data are properly set, as well as fixing eventStream `.foundTransaction` reporting.

### Fix incorrect note deduplication in v_transactions (librustzcash)
This is a fix in the rust layer. The amount sent in the transaction was incorrectly reported even though the actual amount was sent properly. Now clients should see the amount they expect to see in the UI.

# 2.0.2 - 2023-10-12

## Changed

### [#1303] Don't invalidate the timer with the error
The SDK has some simple logic of retrying when some erros occurs. There were 5 attempts of retry until the SDK stopped the synchronization process completely. (The timer is not restarted after those). That approach led to some annoying UX issue of manually starting the SDKSynchronizer from the client, shifting the responsibility to the devs/clients. This has been changed, the SDK never stops the timer unless `synchronizer.stop()` is called.

## Fixed

### [#1301] foundTransactions don't emit after rewind
The `.foundTransactions` observed on eventStream worked well during the sync until the rewind was called. That API missed reset of the ActionContext in the CompactBlockProcesser and that led to never observing the same transactions again. This ticket fixed the problem, reset is called in the rewind and new sync passes the transactions to the stream.

# 2.0.1 - 2023-10-03

## Changed

### [#1294] Remove all uses of the incorrect 1000-ZAT fee
The 1000 Zatoshi fee proposed in ZIP-313 is deprecated now and so the minimum is 10k Zatoshi, defined in ZIP-317.
The SDK has been cleaned up from deprecated fee but note, real fee is handled in a rust layer.
The public API `NetworkConstants.defaultFee(for: BlockHeight)` has been refactored to `NetworkConstants.defaultFee()`.

# 2.0.0 - 2023-09-25

## Notable Changes

This release updates `ZcashLightClientKit` to implement the Spend-Before-Sync fast
synchronization algorithm.

## Changed

Updated dependencies:
- `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.4.0`

`CompactBlockProcessor` now processes compact blocks from the lightwalletd server with Spend-before-Sync algorithm (i.e. non-linear order). This feature shortens the time after which a wallet's spendable balance can be used.

### [#1196] Check logging level priorities
The levels for logging have been updated according to Log Levels in Swift. (https://www.swift.org/server/guides/libraries/log-levels.html).
There's one naming difference, instead of `notice` we use `event`. So the order is debug, info, event, warning, error.

### [#1111] Change how the sync progress is stored inside the SDK

`Initializer` has now a new parameter called `generalStorageURL`. This URL is the location of the directory
where the SDK can store any information it needs. A directory doesn't have to exist. But the SDK must
be able to write to this location after it creates this directory. It is suggested that this directory is
a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

Synchronizer's prepare(...) public API changed: `viewingKeys:
[UnifiedFullViewingKey]` has been removed and `for walletMode: WalletInitMode`
added. `WalletInitMode` is an enum with 3 cases: .newWallet, .restoreWallet and
.existingWallet. Use `.newWallet` when preparing the SDKSynchronizer for a
brand new wallet that has been generated. Use `.restoreWallet` when wallet is
about to be restored from a seed and `.existingWallet` for all other scenarios.

## Removed

### [#1181] Correct computation of progress for Spend before Sync
`latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from `SynchronizerState`. With multiple algorithms
of syncing the amount of data provided is reduced so it's consistent. Spend before Sync is done in non-linear order
so both Height and Time don't make sense anymore.

### [#1230] Remove linear sync from the SDK

- `latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from the
  SynchronizerState.
- The concept of pending transaction has changed: `func allPendingTransactions()`
  is no longer available. Use `public func allTransactions()` instead.

a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

### [#1019] Memo has trailing garbled text

Changes the way unpadded bytes are turned into a UTF-8 Swift String
without using cString assuming APIs that would overflow memory and
add garbled trailing bytes.

- [#781] This fixes test `testMaxAmountMinusOneSend` by creating two separate tests:
  - testMaxAmountMinusOneSendFails
  - testMaxAmountSend

Also includes new functionality that tracks sent transactions so
that users can be notified specifically when they are mined and uses "idea B" of
issue #1033.

closes #1033
closes #781

### [#1001] Remove PendingDb in favor of `v_transactions` and `v_tx_output` Views

## Changed

- `WalletTransactionEncoder` now uses a `LightWalletService` to submit the
encoded transactions.

- Functions returning or receiving `ZcashTransaction.Sent` or `ZcashTransaction.Received` now
will be simplified by returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` or be replaced by their Overview
counterparts

## Added

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview` can be checked for "pending-ness" by calling`.isPending(latestHeight:)` latest height must be provided so that minedHeight
  can be compared with the lastest and the `defaultStaleTolerance` constant.

- `TransactionRecipient` is now a public type.

- `ZcashTransaction.Output` can be queried to know the inner details of a
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview`. It will return an array with all the tracked
  outputs for that transaction so that they can be shown to users who request them

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.State` is introduced to represent `confirmed`,
  `pending` or `expired` states. This State is relative to the current height
  of the chain that is passed to the function `getState(for currentHeight: BlockHeight)`.

State should be a transient value and it's not adviced to store it unless
transactions have stale values such as `confirmed` or `expired`.

### Synchronizer Changes

- `public func getTransactionOutputs(transaction) async -> [ZcashTransaction.Output]` is added to
get the outputs related to the given transaction. You can use this to know every detail of the
transaction Overview and show it in a more fine-grained UI.

- `TransactionRecipient` is returned on `getRecipients(for:)`.

## Renamed

- `AccountEntity` called `Account` is now `DbAccount`

## Removed

- `ZcashTransaction.Received` and `ZcashTransaction.Sent` are removed
  and replaced by `Overview` since the notion of Sent and received is
  not entirely applicable to Zcash transactions where value can be
  sent and received at the same time. Transactions with negative value
  will be considered as "sent" but that won't be enforced with a type
  anymore
- `cancelSpend()`: support for cancel spend was removed since its
  completion was not guaranteed
- `PendingTransactionEntity` and all of its related components.
  Pending items are still tracked and visualized by the existing APIs
  but they are retrieved from the `TransactionRepository` instead by
  returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` instead.
- `pendingDbURL` is removed from every place it was required. Its
  deletion is responsibility of wallet developers.
- `ClearedTransactions` are now just `transactions`.`MigrationManager`
  is deleted. Now all migrations are in charge of the rust welding layer.
- `PendingTransactionDao.swift` is removed.
- `PendingTransactionRepository` protocol is removed.
- `TransactionManagerError`
- `PersistentTransactionManager`
- `OutboundTransactionManager` is deleted and replaced by `TransactionEncoder`
  which now incorporates `submit(encoded:)` functionality
- `DatabaseMigrationManager` is remove since it's no longer needed all Database
  migrations shall be hanlded by the rust layer.
- `ZcashSDK.defaultPendingDbName` along with any sibling members
- `TransactionRepository`
    - `findMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received)`
    - `findMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent)`

### [#1013] Enable more granular control over logging behavior

Now the SDK allows for more fine-tuning of its logging behavior. The `LoggingPolicy` enum
provides for three options: `.default(OSLogger.LogLevel)` wherein the SDK will use its own logger, with the option
to customize the log level by passing an `OSLogger.LogLevel` to the enum case.
`custom` allows one to pass a custom `Logger` implementation for completely customized logging.
Lastly, `noLogging` disables logging entirely.

To utilize this new configuration option, pass a `loggingPolicy` into the `Initializer`. If unspecified, the SDK
will utilize an internal `Logger` implementation with an `OSLogger.LogLevel` of `.debug`

### [#442] Implement parallel downloading and scanning

The SDK now parallelizes the download and scanning of blocks. If the network connection of the client device is fast enough then the scanning
process doesn't have to wait for blocks to be downloaded. This makes the whole sync process faster.

`Synchronizer.stop()` method is not async anymore.

### [#361] Redesign errors inside the SDK

Now the SDK uses only one error type - `ZcashError`. Each method that throws now throws only `ZcashError`.
Each publisher (or stream) that can emit error now emitts only `ZcashError`.

Each symbol in `ZcashError` enum represents one error. Each error is used only in one place
inside the SDK. Each error has assigned unique error code (`ZcashErrorCode`) which can be used in logs.

### [#969] Clear cache on error to avoid discontinuities when verifying
This change drops the file-system cache whenever an error occurs when storing blocks
so that there is not a discontinuity in the cached block range that could cause a
discontinuity error on libzcashlc when calling `scan_blocks`. This will have a setback of
at most 100 blocks that would have to be re-downloaded when resuming sync.

### [#959] and [#914] Value of outbound transactions does not match user intended tx input

This change switches to a new (future) version of the rust crates that will get
rid of the sent and received transactions Views in favor of a v_transaction
view that will do better accounting of outgoing and incoming funds.
Additionally it will support an outputs view for seeing the inner details of
transactions enabling the SDKs tell the users the precise movement of value
that a tx causes in its multiple possible ways according to the protocol.

the v_tx_outputs view is not yet implemented.

Sent and Received transaction sub-types are kept for compatibility purposes but
they are generated from Overviews instead of queried from a specific view.

In the transaction Overview the value represents the whole value transfer for
the transaction from the point of view of a given account including fees. This
means that the value for a single transaction Overview struct represents the
addition or subtraction of ZEC value to the account's balance.

Future updates will give clients the possibility to drill into the inner
workings of those value changes in a per-output basis for each transaction.

Also, the field pending_unmined field was added to v_transactions so that
wallets can query DataDb for pending but yet unmined txs

This will prepare the field for removing the notion of a "PendingDb" and its nuances.

### [#888] Updates to layer between Swift and Rust

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

`KeyDeriving` protocol is changed. And therefore `DerivationTool` is changed. `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed:accountIndex:)` and
`deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from:)` methods are now async. `DerivationTool` offers alternatives for these methods. Alternatives are using either
closures or Combine.

### [#469] ZcashRustBackendWelding to Async

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

These methods previously returned Optional and now those methods return non-optional value and those methods can an throw error:
- `getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> SaplingAddress`
- `func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> UnifiedAddress`
- `func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> TransparentAddress`

These methods are now async:
- `func getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`
- `func getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`

`Initializer` no longer have methods to get balance. Use `SDKSynchronizer` (or it's alternative APIs) to get balance.

- `func getVerifiedBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
  use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an

- `func getSentMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
  Use `getSentMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead

## Changed

### [#209] Support Initializer Aliases

Added `ZcashSynchronizerAlias` enum which is used to identify an instance of the `SDKSynchronizer`. All the paths
to all resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are updated automatically inside the SDK according to the
alias. So it's safe to create multiple instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`. Each instance must have unique Alias. If
the `default` alias is used then the SDK works the same as before this change was introduced.

The SDK now also checks which aliases are used and it prevents situations when two instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`
has the same alias. Methods `prepare()` and `wipe()` do checks for used alias. And those methods fail
with `InitializerError.aliasAlreadyInUse` if the alias is already used.

If the alias check fails in the `prepare()` method then the status of the `SDKSynchronizer` isn't switched from `unprepared`.
These methods newly throw `SynchronizerError.notPrepared` error when the status is `unprepared`:
- `sendToAddress(spendingKey:zatoshi:toAddress:memo:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `shieldFundsspendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `latestUTXOs(address:) async throws -> [UnspentTransactionOutputEntity]`
- `refreshUTXOs(address:from:) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
- `rewind(policy:) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error>`

Provided file URLs to resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are now parsed inside the SDK and updated
according to the alias. If some error during this happens then `SDKSynchronzer.prepare()` method throws
`InitializerError.cantUpdateURLWithAlias` error.

### [#831] Add support for alternative APIs

There are two new protocols (`ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer`). And there are two new
objects which conform to respective protocols (`ClosureSDKSynchronizer` and `CombineSDKSynchronizer`). These
new objects offer alternative API for the `SDKSynchronizer`. Now the client app can choose which technology
it wants to use to communicate with Zcash SDK and it isn't forced to use async.

These methods in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `prepare(with:viewingKeys:walletBirthday:)`
- `start(retry:)`
- `stop()`
- `cancelSpend(transaction:)`
- All the variants of the `getMemos(for:)` method.
- All the variants fo the `getRecipients(for:)` method.
- `allConfirmedTransactions(from:limit:)`

These properties in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `pendingTransactions`
- `clearedTransactions`
- `sentTransactions`
- `receivedTransactions`

Non async `SDKsynchronizer.latestHeight(result:)` were moved to `ClosureSDKSynchronizer`.

### [#724] Switch from event based notifications to state based notifications

The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers. Check the migrating document and
documentation in the code to get more information.

### [#826] Change how the SDK is initialized

- `viewingKeys` and `walletBirthday` are removed from `Initializer` constuctor. These parameters moved to
  `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` function.
- Constructor of the `SDKSynchronizer` no longer throws exception.
- Any value emitted from `lastState` stream before `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` is called has `latestScannedHeight` set to 0.
- `Initializer.initialize` function isn't public anymore. To initialize SDK call `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` instead.

## Fixed

### [#821] `failedToWriteMetadata` at sync startup

No public API changes.

Adds `func shouldClearBlockCacheAndUpdateInternalState() -> BlockHeight?` to `SyncRanges`
so that the compact block processor can advert internal states that are not consistent and
recover from such state.

For concrete examples check out the tests in:
`Tests/NetworkTests/CompactBlockProcessorTests.swift`

## Deleted
Removed linter binary from repository

# 0.19.0-beta

### [#816] Improve how rewind call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.rewind(policy:)` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the rewind is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#801] Improve how wipe call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.wipe()` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the wipe is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#793] Send synchronizerStopped notification only when sync process stops

`synchronizerStopped` notification is now sent after the sync process stops. It's
not sent right when `stop()` method is called.

### [#795] Include sapling-spend file into bundle for tests

This is only an internal change and doesn't change the behavior of the SDK. `Initializer`'s
constructor has a new parameter `saplingParamsSourceURL`. Use `SaplingParamsSourceURL.default`
value for this parameter.

### [#764] Refactor communication between components inside th SDK

This is mostly an internal change. A consequence of this change is that all the notifications
delivered via `NotificationCenter` with the prefix `blockProcessor` are now gone. If affected
notifications were used in your code use notifications with the prefix `synchronizer` now.
These notifications are defined in `SDKSynchronizer.swift`.

### [#759] Remove Jazz-generated HTML docs

We remove these documents since they are outdated and we rely on the docs in the code itself.

### [#726] Modularize GRPC layer

This is mostly internal change. `LightWalletService` is no longer public. If it
is used in your code replace it by using `SDKSynchronizer` API.

### [#770] Update GRPC swift library
This updates to GRPC-Swift 1.14.0.

## File system backed block cache

File system based block cache. Compact blocks will now be stored
on the file system. Caller must provide a `URL` pointing to the
filesystem root directory where the fsBlock cache is. this directory
is expected to contain a `/blocks` sub-directory with the blocks stored
in the convened filename format `{height}-{hash}-compactblock`. This directory
must be granted both read and write permissions.

the file system cache will have a "bookkeeping" database that the rust
welding layer will use to know the state of the cache and locate the
cached compact blocks. This directory can be deleted provided that the
Compactblock processor or Synchronizer are not running. Upon deletion
caller is responsible for initializing these objects for the cache to
be created.

Implementation notes: Users of the SDK will know the path they will
provide but must assume no behavior whatsoever or rely on the cached
information in any way, since it is an internal state of the SDK.
Maintainers might provide no support for problems related to speculative
use of the file system cache. If you consider your application needs any
other information than the one available through public APIs, please
file the corresponding feature request.

### Added

- `Synchronizer.shieldFunds(spendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold)` shieldingThreshold
was added allowing wallets to manage their own shielding policies.

### Removed
- `InitializerError.cacheDbMigrationFailed`

### Deprecations
CacheDb references that were deprecated instead of **deleted** are pointing out
that they should be useful for you to migrate from using cacheDb.

- `ResourceProvider.cacheDbURL` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

- `NetworkConstants.defaultCacheDbName` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

## Bugfixes

### [#645] Default rewind after ReOrg is 20 blocks when it should be 10
This fixes an issue where the default reorg was 20 blocks rewind instead of 10. The
reorg count was incremented before calling the rewind height computing function.

## Use Librustzcash database views to query and represent transactions

### [#556] Change data structures which represent transactions.

These data types are gone: `Transaction`, `TransactionEntity`, `ConfirmedTransaction`,
`ConfirmedTransactionEntity`. And these data types were added: `ZcashTransaction.Overview`,
`ZcashTransaction.Received`, `ZcashTransaction.Sent`.

New data structures are very similar to the old ones. Although there many breaking changes.
The APIs of the `SDKSynchronizer` remain unchanged in their behavior. They return different
data types. **When adopting this change, you should check which data types are used by methods
of the `SDKSynchronizer` in your code and change them accordingly.**

New transaction structures no longer have a `memo` property. This responds to the fact that
Zcash transactions can have either none or multiple memos. To get memos for the transaction
the `SDKSynchronizer` has now new methods to fetch those:
- `func getMemos(for transaction: ZcashTransaction.Overview) throws -> [Memo]`,
- `func getMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received) throws -> [Memo]`
- `func getMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent) throws -> [Memo]`

## CompactBlockProcessor is now internal
### [#671] Make CompactBlockProcessor Internal.

The CompactBlockProcessor is no longer a public class/API. Any direct access will
end up as a compiler error. Recommended way how to handle things is via `SDKSynchronizer`
from now on. The Demo app has been updated accordingly as well.

## We've changed how we download and scan blocks. Status reporting has changed.

### [#657] Change how blocks are downloaded and scanned.

In previous versions, the SDK first downloaded all the blocks and then it
scanned all the blocks. This approach requires a lot of disk space. The SDK now
behaves differently. It downloads a batch of blocks (100 by default), scans those, and
removes those blocks from the disk. And repeats this until all the blocks are processed.

`SyncStatus` was changed. `.downloading`, `.validating`, and `.scanning` symbols
were removed. And the `.scanning` symbol was added. The removed phases of the sync
process are now reported as one phase.

Notifications were also changed similarly. These notifications were
removed: `SDKSynchronizerDownloading`, `SDKSyncronizerValidating`, and `SDKSyncronizerScanning`.
And the `SDKSynchronizerSyncing` notification was added. The added notification replaces
the removed notifications.

## New Wipe Method to delete wallet information. Use with care.

### [#677] Add support for wallet wipe into SDK. Add new method `Synchronizer.wipe()`.

## Benchmarking APIs: A primer

### [#663] Foundations for the benchmarking/performance testing in the SDK.

This change presents 2 building blocks for the future automated tests, consisting
of a new SDKMetrics interface to control flow of the data in the SDK and
new performance (unit) test measuring synchronization of 100 mainnet blocks.

### [#646] SDK sync process resumes to previously saved block height
This change adds an internal storage test on UserDefaults that tells the
SDK where sync was left off when cancelled whatever the reason for it
to restart on a later attempt. This fixes some issues around syncing
long block ranges in several attempts not enhancing the right transactions
because the enhancing phase would only consider the last range scanned.
This only fixes the situation where rewinding the SDK would cause the
whole database to be cleared instead and syncing to be restarted from
scratch (issue [#660]).

- commit `3b7202c` Fix `testShieldFunds()` dataset loading issue. (#659)

# 0.16.10-beta

- [#532] [0.16.x-beta] Download does not stop correctly

  Issue Reported:

  When the synchronizer is stopped, the processor does not cancel
  the download correctly. Then when attempting to resume sync, the
  synchronizer is not on `.stopped` and can't be resumed

  this doesn't appear to happen in `master` branch that uses
  structured concurrency for operations.

  Fix:

  This commit makes sure that the download streamer checks cancelation
  before processing any block, or getting called back to report progress

  Default download batch constant is deprecated in favor of `DefaultDownloadBatch` and
  `DefaultScanningBatch`

# 0.16.3-beta

- [#436] Add checkpoint with a lower interval on mainnet (#437)
  This adds checkpoint at a 2500 block interval to help reduce scan times
  on new wallets

# 0.16.2-beta

- [#418] "Swift.EncodingError.InvalidValue Encoding an Int64 is not supported" (#430)
  This fixes Cocoapods clients pointing to SQLite 0.12.2 instead of using 0.13
  the former does not support custom encoding of Int64 and makes Zatoshi break

- [#428] make some helpers publicly accessible (#429)

# 0.16.1-beta

- [#422] Make Zatoshi extensions of `NSDecimalNumber` public (#423)
- [#419] Fix Unavailable Transport 14 when attempting to sync (#426)

  on `LightWalletEndpoint`

- [#416] Update GRPC to 1.8.2 (#421)

# 0.16.0-beta

This version changes the way wallet birthdays are handled. `WalletBirthday`
struct is not longer public and has been renamed to `Checkpoint`.

`SynchronizerError` has a default `LocalizedError` compliance to
help debug errors and display them to the user. This is a workaround
to get rid of cryptic errors that are being reported to maintainers and
are subject to change in future versions.

- [#392] Synchronizer error 8. when syncing. (#413)
- [#398] Make WalletBirthday an internal type (#414)

  this build is a hotfix for cocoapods. which has the wront SQLite dependency
  It moves it from 0.12.2 to 0.13

# 0.15.0-beta

** IMPORTANT ** This version no longer supports iOS 12
We've made a decision to make iOS 13 the minimum deployment target
in order to adopt and support Structured Concurrency and other important features
of the Swift language like Combine.

- [#363] bump iOS minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 (#407)
- [#381] Move Zatoshi and Amount Types to the SDK (#396)
  This deprecates many methods on `SDKSynchronizer` using Zatoshi for amounts
  instead of `Int64`. This exposes number formatters that conveniently provide
  decimal conversion from `Zatoshi` to "human-readable" ZEC decimal numbers.

- [#397] Checkpoint format that supports NU5 TreeStates (#399)
  `WalletBirthday` now have both `saplingTree` and `orchardTree` values. The
  latter being Optional for checkpoints prior to Orchard activation height.

# 0.13.1-beta

- [#326] Load Checkpoint files from bundle.
  This is great news! now checkpoints are loaded from files on the bundle instead of
  hardcoding them on source files. This will make updates easier, less error prone,
  and mostly automatable.
