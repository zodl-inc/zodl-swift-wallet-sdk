    /// restart mid-pass — would otherwise get `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately. SQLite.swift's `FailableIterator`
    /// resolves a step error with `try!`, an UNCATCHABLE trap, so that `SQLITE_BUSY` crashes the app
    /// (no `do/catch` or `try?` can intercept it). A busy timeout makes the read wait for the lock to
