/// Protocol for creating transactions without immediate submission and for
/// submitting them to one or more lightwalletd endpoints in parallel.
///
/// This separates transaction creation and network submission from the broader
/// synchronization lifecycle managed by ``Synchronizer``.
///
/// Transactions created through this API wait for the caller to submit them —
/// the SDK's background resubmission skips them until then. Once submitted,
/// the endpoint list is recorded as the transaction's retry plan and background
/// resubmission retries through those endpoints instead of the synchronizer's
/// default endpoint.
///
/// Typical usage:
/// ```swift
/// let transactions = try await synchronizer.broadcaster.createProposedTransactions(
///     proposal: proposal, spendingKey: spendingKey
/// )
/// let reports = await synchronizer.broadcaster.submit(
///     transactions: transactions, to: endpoints
/// )
/// ```
