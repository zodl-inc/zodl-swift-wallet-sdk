/// A pure, measured-block-rate chain-tip estimator: projects a wall-clock ESTIMATED chain tip
/// from the most recently scanned blocks' `(height, header time)` samples
/// (`ZcashRustBackendWelding.migrationBlockRateSamples(window:)`).
///
/// The projection feeds the migration delivery lane's `estimatedTip` inputs
/// (`migrationHasOverdueTransfers(for:estimatedTip:)` / `migrationAdvanceStep(for:estimatedTip:)`)
/// AND — since upstream #2927 — the overdue re-spread inside `advance_migration`, which is
/// **judged and sized at the estimate and PERSISTED**: an over-estimate is no longer "at worst an
/// early due answer"; it writes phantom deferral into the stored schedule. Accuracy here is
/// load-bearing. (Field incident, 2026-08-08 `data37`: a burst-skewed measurement compounded by
/// two wake-time re-spreads parked a live testnet run ~2,690 blocks — half a day — past the real
/// chain. The engine-side hardening — bounding what a caller estimate may size — is tracked
/// separately; this type's job is to not hand it poison in the first place.)
///
/// THE RATE IS A SPAN, NOT A DELTA MEAN. `secondsPerBlock()` divides the window's total
/// header-time span by its total height span. The previous implementation averaged consecutive
/// per-delta spacings, each clamped to [``minSecondsPerBlock``, ``maxSecondsPerBlock``] — a
/// statistic that is biased LOW on bimodal spacing: testnet's min-difficulty rule yields bursts
/// (seconds apart, clamped UP to 5) punctuated by gaps (clamped DOWN to 150), and the bursts
/// dominate by count. A span is immune: a gap and the burst it triggers average out inside it. A
/// span also needs no adjacency assumption — non-consecutive sample heights divide by the true
/// height distance instead of counting rows.
///
/// THE WINDOW IS ABSENCE-SCALED. The rate is extrapolated across app-dead gaps measured in hours,
/// so the sample span must cover hours: ``sampleWindow`` is 1000 blocks (~21 h at target spacing;
/// ~6–9 h on a burst-fast testnet). The prior 100-block window (~2 h at target, and as little as
/// ~30 min on a fast chain) measured whatever regime the chain happened to be in right before
/// sleep and projected it across the whole night — in the field incident the pre-sleep half hour
/// ran ~20 s/block while the night averaged 31 s/block, an error the span statistic alone cannot
/// fix.
///
/// Constants heritage: the clamps and fallback still mirror the Android SDK's estimator; the
/// method (span vs clamped-delta mean) and the window (1000 vs 100) deliberately diverge — the
/// Kotlin estimator retains the biased statistic and the short window and needs the same fix.
