//
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer+StallWatchdog.swift
//  ZODLSwiftWalletSDK
//
//  Created for Slipstream task [#1755] — B4 failure-path hardening.
//
//  Detects the silent-freeze failure mode (field report 2026-06-12): the engine
//  state stuck at Syncing while NO progress counter moves — the Rust sync task
//  hung (transport stall) or died (panic; the Rust-side B1 supervisor now also
//  surfaces panics as Error state). The watchdog only LOGS — one loud
//  `Logger.error` per stall episode, carrying the full last snapshot. It never
//  restarts anything: recovery policy stays with the app.
//
//  The pure decision predicate (`isSyncStalled`) lives in
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer+PureHelpers.swift and is unit-tested in OfflineTests.

        // stop, which fired the log at the precise moment recovery was succeeding; field-caught
        // 2026-08-02). Only stall time the CURRENT handle actually accrued may fire it.
