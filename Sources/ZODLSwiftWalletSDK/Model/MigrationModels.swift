/// The migration engine's next-step decision for the stored Orchard -> Ironwood run, as surfaced
/// by `Synchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` /
/// `ZcashRustBackendWelding.migrationAdvanceStep(for:)`.
///
/// A conduit of the upstream engine's public `advance_migration` API: every upstream case
/// marshals onto its own case here — ``replan`` and ``reevaluate`` included, bare, exactly as
/// upstream carries them. (The interim `requiresAttention(id:)` collapse, which folded both
/// behind one synthesised transaction id, is retired — 2026-08-08.)
/// `nil` at the API level (the call returns an optional) means no migration run is stored at all —
/// none was ever committed for the account — so there is nothing to advance and nothing to poll.
/// The engine's priority order: ``reevaluate`` outranks everything (an open rejection report
/// freezes adjudication until the scan catches up), ``replan`` ends the drive until the user
/// re-plans, and a proven, due transaction broadcasts ahead of any new proving work (its
/// broadcast window is the scarcer resource; proving can happen on any later wake-up).
///
/// Evaluated with both the wallet's fully-scanned target and its wall-clock tip estimate. Upstream
/// uses the estimate only for reversible scheduling/withholding; persisted or destructive
/// judgments remain anchored to scanned data. It is also memoryless about sessions: it reports
/// what the run needs next, not whether doing it now would pair a broadcast
/// with a sync — session policy (one broadcast per session, no sync in a broadcast session)
/// belongs to the caller and the sync gate, not to this value.
///
/// Discharging each step:
/// - ``reevaluate`` → SYNC (to at least the tip the rejecting node reported), then call
///   `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` again: the engine adjudicates against the newly scanned
///   data and, where the rejection was transient, re-offers the work in that same call. Not a
///   user-facing state — the run is alive and nothing is asked of anyone but the syncer.
/// - ``replan`` → the run is finished deciding and is not driven further: surface the re-plan UX
///   over the ``MigrationTransactionStatus/State/invalid(reason:)`` row(s), then
///   `restartCurrentMigrationStep(accountUUID:)` to cancel and re-plan. No sync first — the
///   verdict is already persisted and cannot be scanned away.
/// - ``broadcast(_:)`` → `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)`: hand the case's
///   opaque ``MigrationBroadcastInstruction`` straight to the executor and end the session — a
///   broadcast session must not sync.
/// - ``prove(transactions:)`` → the WHOLE batch is ready, and the batch IS the instruction: hand
///   it to `proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)` at a sync wake-up (see
///   `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)`), which proves up to the caller's budget from that pass. Each
///   entry's ``MigrationProveTarget/kind`` distinguishes what follows for THAT transaction: a
///   ``MigrationTransactionStatus/Kind/transfer(crossing:)`` entry's broadcast follows in its own
///   LATER session — proving has no deadline of its own, a transfer's boundary anchor checkpoint
///   is durably retained, so a missed wake-up defers the proof, never invalidates it — while a
///   ``MigrationTransactionStatus/Kind/preparation(layer:index:)`` entry is due by construction
///   (the engine only reports a preparation prove once its broadcast height has arrived and its
///   dependencies are mined) and proves against a near-tip witnessable anchor rather than a drawn
///   boundary, so it may broadcast at the SAME wake-up. Broadcast itself remains a separate later
///   step, served one transaction at a time.
/// - ``rebuild(id:)`` → `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` — needs spend
///   authority (a spending key in-process, or the external-signer re-serve ceremony).
/// - ``waiting`` → nothing is actionable now: register OS wake-ups at the heights
///   `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)` returns, plus each status row's
///   ``MigrationTransactionStatus/scheduledHeight`` for the broadcast windows.
///
/// ``complete`` is terminal for the STORED run — including a CANCELLED one, which the engine also
/// reports as complete rather than ever driving it further — and means "stop polling this run".
