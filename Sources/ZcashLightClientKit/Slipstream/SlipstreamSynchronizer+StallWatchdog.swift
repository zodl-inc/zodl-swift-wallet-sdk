//
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer+StallWatchdog.swift
//  ZcashLightClientKit
//
//  Created for Slipstream task [#1755] — B4 failure-path hardening.
//
//  Detects the silent-freeze failure mode (field report 2026-06-12): the engine
//  state stuck at Syncing while NO progress counter moves — the Rust sync task
//  hung (transport stall) or died (panic; the Rust-side B1 supervisor now also
//  surfaces panics as Error state). The watchdog LOGS — one loud `Logger.error`
//  per stall episode, carrying the full last snapshot — and REPORTS the stall
//  fact to the poll loop, which restarts the pass under the bounded policy in
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer+PureHelpers.swift (`stallRecoveryDecision`, MOB-1850).
//
//  The pure decision predicate (`isSyncStalled`) lives in
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer+PureHelpers.swift and is unit-tested in OfflineTests.
