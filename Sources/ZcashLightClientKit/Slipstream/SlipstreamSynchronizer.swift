//
//  SlipstreamSynchronizer.swift
//  ZcashLightClientKit
//
//  Created for Slipstream task [#1755].
//
//  Implements the `Synchronizer` protocol using:
//    - Sync members  → `SlipstreamEngine` (open / start / stop / snapshot / drainEvents)
//    - Data members  → `TransactionRepository` + `ZcashRustBackendWelding`
//                      resolved from the SAME `DIContainer` as `SDKSynchronizer`
//    - State stream  → `CurrentValueSubject<SynchronizerState, Never>` updated by a 2-second
//                      polling `Task` that calls `engine.snapshot()` and `engine.drainEvents()`
//    - Event stream  → `PassthroughSubject<SynchronizerEvent, Never>` emits `foundTransactions`
//                      from the polling tick when the engine reports SyncDone with txs
//
//  Delegation notes (T4.3 / T4.6):
//    Sync-side:      prepare / start / stop / stateStream / eventStream / rescanFrom /
//                    rewind / wipe / switchTo / latestHeight (9 members on engine + light service)
//    Delegated:      ~40 data-model members delegated to transactionRepository / rustBackend /
//                    transactionEncoder / broadcaster / checkpointSource / torClient
//    Honest-unsupported (throw or log): switchTo only (T4.6 ships real wipe)

    // unmined, unexpired transactions are re-broadcast through their recorded submit plans,
    // and plans whose transactions expired are pruned. `SlipstreamSynchronizer` has no action
    // list, so the poll loop drives it — `tickPoll` asks `maybeRunTxResubmission` on every
    // 2 s tick and the guards below decide.
    //
    // Two cadences, deliberately: the CHECK runs at most every
    // `resubmissionCheckInterval` (60 s — it walks the transaction table and the plan store),
    // while the actual re-broadcast is throttled to 300 s INSIDE `TxResubmitter`
    // (`Constants.thresholdToTrigger`, shared with the old pipeline). The prune runs on every
    // check. This host duplicates neither number.
    //
    // Teardown (`stopImpl`, `wipeImpl`) only CANCELS `resubmissionTask`; it never nils the
    // handle. The fired task clears it itself, as its last step, through the actor-isolated
    // `finishResubmissionCheck()` — a single writer. If teardown also nil'd the handle, a fast
    // stop→start could let a stale task's finish clear a NEWER task's handle and re-open the
    // spawn guard while that new task still runs (double-spawn). Cancel-only teardown keeps
    // the guard closed until the cancelled task's own finish clears it, which is benign and
    // self-healing. Note the LIMIT of that cancellation: only the SUBMIT stage observes it
    // (`SubmitPlanExecutor.submit` checks `Task.checkCancellation`, and `TxResubmitter` catches
    // per transaction). The prune stage has no cancellation checks at all and runs to
    // completion — which is why `wipeImpl` cancels AND joins (below), rather than trusting
    // cancellation to stop a check that would otherwise write to files it is deleting.
    //
    // The driver is also gated on the CALLER's cancellation (`isCancelled`, defaulted to
    // `Task.isCancelled` so it is evaluated in the caller's task context). `stopPolling()`
    // cancels `pollTask` without awaiting it, and teardown then suspends (`engine.stop()`,
    // `engine.close()`), so a `tickPoll` that was suspended mid-tick can RESUME inside the
    // teardown and walk on to this driver. Without that gate a wipe could spawn a fresh,
    // uncancelled check that reads `data.db` and re-creates the submit-plan database SQLite
    // just deleted (a connect resurrects the file), undoing [#1976] a few milliseconds later.
