    // to the app: note-split preparation and submission, transfer scheduling, the advance drive
    // and its instruction executors, on-launch reconciliation/recovery, and external (PCZT)
    // signing. None of these methods require `prepare()` to have been called — a host may
    // broadcast a migration transfer from a background session without ever starting sync.
    //
    // The action surface is exactly three things: the conduit (`migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)`),
    // the instruction executors (`proveMigrationTransactions`, `performMigrationBroadcast`,
    // `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers`), and reads. The app has no semantic goal except to advance
    // the migration and perform the advancement's dictates, and no member decides for itself what
    // the migration needs: `MigrationBroadcastInstruction` and `MigrationProveTarget` have no
    // public initializers, so the advance marshaling is their only producer and un-instructed
    // proving or broadcasting does not compile. This is a Swift-surface property, not a security
    // boundary — the Rust executors' per-row state gating remains the safety backstop.
    //
    // The ceremony/consent lane is deliberately untouched by this: `prepareNoteSplit` /
    // `submitNoteSplit` and the propose/sign/store family are pre-drive consent flows — a user
    // approving a plan that does not exist yet — so there is no instruction for them to carry.
