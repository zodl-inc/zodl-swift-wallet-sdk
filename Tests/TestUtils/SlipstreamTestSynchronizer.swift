    /// Builds a `SlipstreamSynchronizer` around an injected engine, wired exactly as the shipped one
    /// is: the same container, the same `Initializer` arguments, the same production `init` body —
    /// only the engine is the caller's.
    ///
    /// Promoted here from `SlipstreamStallRecoveryPolicyTests` so every Slipstream lifecycle test
    /// shares one definition of "a synchronizer over test doubles"; a divergence between two such
    /// setups is the kind of thing that makes one test's failure unreproducible in another.
    ///
    /// The three container mocks are what `SlipstreamSynchronizer.init` and `start()` reach for:
    /// `ZcashRustBackendWelding` backs both `initializer.rustBackend` and the migration host's
    /// sync-blocked predicate, `LightWalletService` and `TransactionRepository` are resolved while
    /// the object graph is built. The welding mock's `listAccounts` is defaulted to "no accounts"
    /// because `start()`'s migration privacy gate calls it unconditionally, and the generated mock's
    /// un-stubbed return value is implicitly unwrapped — an un-defaulted call is a crash, not a
    /// failure. A caller that supplies its own `welding` owns that decision, and this leaves an
    /// answer it already stubbed untouched.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - engine: the engine the synchronizer drives. A `GatedFakeSlipstreamEngine` for a
    ///     lifecycle test; a real `SlipstreamEngine` would work too.
    ///   - container: the DI container to build over. Defaults to the test case's `mockContainer`.
    ///   - welding: the rust-backend double to register. Defaults to a fresh, minimally stubbed one.
    ///   - endpoint: the initial server. Never dialled by a fake engine.
    ///   - network: the Zcash network. Testnet by default, as every offline Slipstream test uses.
    ///   - alternateEndpoints: recorded on the synchronizer; the engine's own alternates are the
    ///     caller's business, since the caller built the engine.
