/// A latch a test opens to release calls suspended on it.
///
/// A closed gate suspends every caller of `wait()`; `open()` resumes all of them and every later
/// caller passes straight through. That is exactly enough to pin an interleaving: hold the engine
/// inside `stop()` while the synchronizer's next `start()` runs, then let the stop finish and assert
/// on the order the two landed in.
///
/// `close()` re-arms the latch. It was deliberately absent at first, because a gate that shuts at an
/// unknown moment makes a test's outcome depend on WHEN it shut — the property these tests exist to
/// delete. The [MOB-1850] lifecycle tests need it anyway: a synchronizer must be brought up through
/// a real `start()` (which snapshots twice) before the interleaving under test can be arranged, so
/// the gate that will hold the next call has to be open first. The rule that keeps it deterministic
/// is the caller's: close a gate only while no call is inside it, and then wait on an OBSERVABLE
/// (`onCall`, or the recorded call log) rather than on elapsed time before assuming a call arrived.
