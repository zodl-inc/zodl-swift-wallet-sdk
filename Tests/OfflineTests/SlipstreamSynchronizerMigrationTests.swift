//
//  SlipstreamSynchronizerMigrationTests.swift
//  OfflineTests
//
//  Tests `SlipstreamSynchronizer`'s migration group (R4-C): the same 32 `Synchronizer` protocol
//  requirements `SDKSynchronizer` implements (see `SDKSynchronizerMigrationTests`), as thin forwards
//  to a seamed `OrchardMigrationHost` -- except the DB-free, account-free Keystone batch-signing
//  bridge (4 members, #1806), which forwards straight to `initializer.rustBackend` instead,
//  bypassing the host entirely -- plus the two SDK-enforced session-separation behaviors -- the
//  `start()` privacy gate and the `submitNoteSplit`/`performMigrationBroadcast` broadcast
//  guard -- mirrored onto the actor.
//
//  Driven through the host's injecting initializer + a scripted actor factory, exactly like
//  `SDKSynchronizerMigrationTests`, with the host substituted into a real `SlipstreamSynchronizer` via
//  the same container-mock seam (`container.mock(type: OrchardMigrationHost.self, ...)`) that
//  `SlipstreamSynchronizer.init` resolves against.
//
//  The two enforcement suites need `latestState.internalSyncStatus` in a specific case (`.disconnected`
//  to satisfy `start(retry:)`'s `isPrepared` guard; `.syncing` to exercise the broadcast guard) without
//  going through `prepare()`/`start()` for real: unlike `SDKSynchronizer` (whose package-visible
//  `updateStatus(_:)` its own tests reuse directly), `SlipstreamSynchronizer`'s only OTHER way to reach
//  a non-`.unprepared` status is the real engine -- and driving `.syncing` through a genuine `start()`
//  spawns the real background poll loop, whose `tickPoll()` calls `engine.walletSummary()` (documented
//  as unsafe to call "mid-scan" -- it can run long against a wallet that is actively, unsuccessfully,
//  trying to reach a server) on the SAME actor `engine.stop()` needs, so a leaked in-flight summary
//  walk can block teardown well past any reasonable test deadline and bleed into whatever test the
//  process runs next (this was caught empirically: an earlier version of this suite that drove state
//  through real `prepare()`/`start()` calls intermittently starved
//  `WalletTests.testWalletInitialization`, elsewhere in this same `OfflineTests` target, of its mocked
//  service interaction). `SlipstreamSynchronizer.setInternalSyncStatusForTesting(_:)` -- a small
//  `internal` seam added alongside this suite for exactly this purpose -- sidesteps all of that: it
//  writes `stateSubject` directly, the same way `stopImpl()`/`tickPoll()` do internally, with no engine
//  or poll-loop involvement at all.
//
//  No network, no real FFI beyond local SQLite/key-derivation calls that `Initializer`/`TestsData`
//  already make offline elsewhere in this suite (see `WalletTests.testWalletInitialization` and
//  `SlipstreamOfflineTests` for precedent).
