/// [MOB-1850] Who owns the engine, and for how long.
///
/// Two problems meet here. First, a poll tick decides things — that the pass has stalled,
/// what state to publish, whether to re-fetch transactions — and then suspends inside an engine
/// call. By the time it resumes, the pass it decided for may be gone: the app stopped the
/// synchronizer, a server switch replaced the handle, a wipe deleted the wallet. Acting on a
/// decision taken for a pass that no longer exists is how a deliberately stopped synchronizer came
/// back to life. Second, the stall recovery tears the engine down and brings it back up, and while
/// it was an unstructured task racing every other lifecycle path, it could tear down a pass a
/// switch had just started, or start the engine in the middle of an account mutation's stopped
/// interval — the interval that exists precisely because no pass may run across the mutation.
///
/// The fix has two halves, and this suite exercises both:
///
/// - Every pass-owning lifecycle operation (start, stop, switch, import, delete, rewind, wipe, and
///   the recovery restart) runs on one FIFO queue, so two of them can never interleave.
/// - A tick carries a run identity (`passGeneration` + `pollGeneration`) that it re-validates after
///   every suspension, so a stale tick returns having done nothing at all.
