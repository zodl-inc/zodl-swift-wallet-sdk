#!/bin/bash
# Prepare FFI artifacts for an SDK release
# Usage: ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh [--force-overwrite-existing-release] <version>
#
# This is the CANONICAL build+upload path for releases. It:
#   1. Builds the full xcframework (all architectures)
#   2. Creates a zip archive with checksum
#   3. Uploads to GitHub as a DRAFT release
#   4. Writes release info to BuildSupport/products/release.env
#   5. Outputs the values needed for Package.swift
#
# Versions with a SemVer pre-release suffix (e.g. 2.6.0-alpha.1, 2.7.0-rc.2)
# are detected automatically and the GitHub release is marked as a pre-release.
#
# After running this script:
#   1. Update Package.swift with the URL and checksum
#   2. Commit the Package.swift change
#   3. Create a signed tag for the SDK release
#   4. Publish the draft release on GitHub
#
# Or use ./Scripts/release.sh to automate all of the above.
#
# Options:
#   --force-overwrite-existing-release  Allow overwriting an existing release
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated (https://cli.github.com/)
#   - Rust toolchain with all Apple targets
