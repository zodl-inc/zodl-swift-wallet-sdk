# prepare-release.sh: cut a release for review, then build and attach its
# artifacts.
#
# A release happens in two phases, with a human reading the pull request in
# between.
#
#   start      Cut release/X.Y.Z from the previous release tag and
#              candidate/X.Y.Z from the revision being released, promote the
#              CHANGELOG, and open a DRAFT pull request from candidate into
#              release. That PR's diff is exactly what users receive relative
#              to the previous release, with none of the intervening history.
#
#   build      After that PR has been reviewed: bump the version everywhere it
#              is recorded, build and upload the XCFramework, point
#              Package.swift at it, extend candidate/X.Y.Z with the result, and
#              mark the PR ready for review.
#
#   artifacts  Build, zip and upload the XCFramework alone. Touches no git or
#              pull-request state; this is what .github/workflows/build-ffi.yml
#              runs, and what `build --artifacts local` uses underneath.
#
# Once the pull request has merged, Scripts/release.sh tags and publishes.
#
# Run `./Scripts/prepare-release.sh <subcommand> --help` for the options of
# each phase.

usage_start() {
    cat <<'EOF'
Usage: ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh start --issue <N> [options] <remote> <version> [<revision>]

Phase one of a release. Creates release/X.Y.Z from the previous release tag and
pushes it; creates candidate/X.Y.Z from the revision being released; promotes
the CHANGELOG's Unreleased section; and opens a DRAFT pull request from the
candidate branch into the release branch.

Basing the release branch on the previous release tag is what makes the pull
request worth reviewing: its diff is exactly what users receive relative to the
last release, rather than the intervening development history.

It deliberately does not build anything. The binary target's URL and checksum
cannot exist until the XCFramework has been built and uploaded, which is what
`prepare-release.sh build` does after this PR has been reviewed.

Arguments:
  <remote>    git remote for the repository being released, e.g. upstream
  <version>   version being released, e.g. 2.7.1
  <revision>  commit or branch holding the changes to release
              (default: current HEAD, which should be a maint/ branch)

Options:
  --issue <N>       release tracking issue; the PR body gets `Closes #N`.
                    Required: every pull request must reference an issue.
  --previous <tag>  base the release branch on this tag rather than the
                    detected one. Use when the newest tag reachable from
                    <revision> is not the release you are following.
  --dry-run         print what would happen and change nothing.

usage_build() {
    cat <<'EOF'
Usage: ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh build [options] <remote> <version>

Phase two of a release, run after the draft pull request from
`prepare-release.sh start` has been reviewed. In order:

  A. Bump the recorded version in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock and
     BuildSupport/platform-Info.plist; commit and push.
  B. Build the XCFramework and upload it as a draft GitHub release.
  C. Point Package.swift at that release; commit and push.
  D. Comment on the pull request and mark it ready for review.

Every step checks whether it has already run and skips if so, so re-running
after a failure resumes rather than starting over. The five-architecture build
is slow enough that this matters.

Options:
  --artifacts local  build the XCFramework on this machine (default)
  --artifacts ci     dispatch .github/workflows/build-ffi.yml on the candidate
                     branch, wait for it, and take the checksum from the asset
                     it uploads. Step A is pushed first, so CI builds the
                     bumped version. The runner performs the same verification
                     before it uploads; --skip-verify here does not reach it.
  --rebuild          rebuild and re-upload even if the draft release already
                     carries the XCFramework
  --skip-verify      do not build and test the SDK against the new XCFramework
                     before uploading it (local builds only)
  --dry-run          print what would happen and change nothing
EOF
}

usage_artifacts() {
    cat <<'EOF'
Usage: ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh artifacts [options] <version>

Build the XCFramework for all five Apple architectures, zip it, and upload it
to GitHub as a DRAFT release. Writes BuildSupport/products/release.env with the
checksum and download URL. A version carrying a pre-release suffix, such as
2.8.0-rc.1, is marked as a pre-release on GitHub.

This touches no git state and no pull request, which is what lets
.github/workflows/build-ffi.yml run it with only `contents: write`. It is also
what `prepare-release.sh build --artifacts local` uses underneath; you rarely
need to run it directly.

It refuses unless Cargo.toml already declares <version>. A dispatched CI build
takes its version from the workflow input but its sources from the branch; were
the two allowed to disagree, the upload would carry the right name and the
wrong library.

Before uploading, it points Package.swift at the framework it just built via
LocalPackages, builds the Swift package, and runs the OfflineTests suite. A
mismatch across the FFI boundary compiles on both sides and fails only at link
or run time, so this is the last point at which one can be caught cheaply.

Options:
  --force-overwrite-existing-release  replace the assets of an existing DRAFT
                                      release. A published release is refused:
                                      Package.swift pins its asset's checksum,
                                      so replacing it breaks every consumer
                                      that has already resolved the version.
  --skip-verify                       do not build and test the SDK against the
                                      new XCFramework before uploading it
  --dry-run                           print what would happen and change nothing

start_pr_body() {

Closes #${issue}

Release \`${version}\`, following \`${prev_tag}\`.

The base of this pull request is \`release/${version}\`, which starts out
identical to \`${prev_tag}\`. Its diff is therefore exactly what users receive
relative to the last release, rather than the intervening development history.

## This is a draft: the artifact phase has not run

Reviewing this diff is the first of two phases. Once it looks right, a
maintainer runs

    ./Scripts/prepare-release.sh build <remote> ${version}

which extends this branch with:

- the version bump, across \`Cargo.toml\`, \`Cargo.lock\` and
  \`BuildSupport/platform-Info.plist\`;
- the \`libzcashlc\` XCFramework, built for all five Apple architectures and
  uploaded as a draft GitHub release;
- \`Package.swift\`, rewritten so its binary target points at that release and
  carries its checksum.

When that has happened a comment will be added here and this pull request will
be marked ready for review. **Do not merge before then.** Merging early tags a
release whose \`Package.swift\` still points at the previous version's
XCFramework.

After merging, \`./Scripts/release.sh <remote> ${version}\` verifies the
checksum against the uploaded asset, signs and pushes the tag, and publishes
the release.

The artifact phase has completed; this branch is ready to be merged and tagged.

- Draft release: https://github.com/${GH_REPO}/releases/tag/${version}
- \`libzcashlc.xcframework.zip\` checksum: \`${checksum}\`

\`Package.swift\` now points at that release. After merging, run

    ./Scripts/release.sh <remote> ${version}

from \`release/${version}\`. It re-verifies the checksum against the uploaded
asset, signs and pushes the tag, and publishes the release.
