# Migrating from previous versions to _Unreleased_

## Migration runs are sized per account — stamp `Account.keystoneKeySource` on a Keystone import

The SDK now reads the `keySource` an account was created or imported with. An account tagged
`Account.keystoneKeySource` (`"keystone"`, compared case-insensitively) has every Orchard→Ironwood
migration run sized to one 96-action Keystone QR signing round; every other account, `nil`
included, keeps the 50-note-per-run sizing it had. No signature changes, but a host that derives
the tag from a display string should switch to the constant, because any other value silently
selects the in-process sizing:

```swift
// Before: a lowercased display string — one localization away from "not a Keystone account".
let accountUUID = try await synchronizer.importAccount(
    ufvk: ufvk,
    seedFingerprint: seedFingerprint,
    zip32AccountIndex: accountIndex,
    purpose: .spending,
    name: name,
    keySource: String(localizable: .accountsKeystone).lowercased(),
    birthday: birthday
)

// After: the SDK's own constant.
let accountUUID = try await synchronizer.importAccount(
    ufvk: ufvk,
    seedFingerprint: seedFingerprint,
    zip32AccountIndex: accountIndex,
    purpose: .spending,
    name: name,
    keySource: Account.keystoneKeySource,
    birthday: birthday
)
```

An account already imported under another tag cannot be re-tagged, and importing the same viewing
key again is rejected as a collision: delete the account (`deleteAccount(_:)`) and import it again
under the constant, accepting the rescan from its birthday.

What to re-check in a migration UI for a Keystone account:

- **More, smaller runs.** `estimateMigrationRuns(accountUUID:)` reports more runs on a large or
  fragmented balance, each with `Run.keystoneSigningSessions == 1`; the total preparation fees and
  the wall-clock migration (each run carries its own broadcast spread) grow with the run count.
  Copy that promised one scan per migration should promise one scan per run.
- **In-flight runs keep their shape.** A run committed before the upgrade was planned under the
  flat cap and may still need several rounds; `restartCurrentMigrationStep(accountUUID:)` cancels
  it and re-plans under the new sizing.
- **`residualAfterMigration(accountUUID:)` now means the whole migration's remainder.** It equals
  `estimateMigrationRuns(accountUUID:).finalResidual` (zero → `nil`), not what the next run alone
  leaves; on a multi-run balance the old figure was mostly the balance the later runs migrate. A
  single-run balance reads the same value as before while the run is pending or in flight — but
  once a run completes, the call now reports the dust that remains where it previously reported
  `nil`, so re-test a `Complete` screen that showed a residual card or a "Lock balance" offer only
  for a non-`nil` value: it now has one. A balance whose canonical split the wallet's notes cannot
  fund now reads the whole spendable balance as the remainder, where the old read threw. Offer
  `lockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:)` only once `proposeMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)`
  returns the empty schedule — the lock takes every spendable note. A host that already holds an
  estimate can read its `finalResidual` instead of paying for a second multi-run estimate.

## Voting rides `zcash_voting` 3.0 — `VotingPirLayout` gains `polyLen`

`VotingPirLayout`'s memberwise initializer gains a required `polyLen: UInt32` — the YPIR RLWE
polynomial degree (2048 or 4096), taken from the dynamic voting config's `pir_layout.poly_len` —
and `precomputeDelegationPir(...)` / `buildAndProveDelegation(...)` consume it through the layout.
`VotingPirLayout.unknown` (`polyLen` 0) fails closed before any private query. Treat a config
without `poly_len` as a configuration error rather than defaulting: the server's dataset geometry
is bound to the value, and 3.0 clients verify the advertised degree at connect.

Helper-server payloads returned by `recoverWireJson(...)` now include `vote_round_id`
(lowercase hex). Remove any app-side injection of that field; the payload remains verbatim wire
JSON — do not decode, re-shape or re-encode it.

## Voting wire payloads are produced by `zcash_voting`, not by the SDK

`VotingSharePayload` is removed and `VotingVoteCommit.sharePayloads` is gone with it. Helper-server
payloads are now obtained after confirmation, one per share index:

```swift
let bundle = try backend.getCommitmentBundle(
    roundId: roundId, bundleIndex: bundleIndex, proposalId: proposalId
)
let payload = try VotingRustBackend.recoverWireJson(
    commitmentBundleJson: bundle!.bundleJson,
    proposalId: proposalId,
    shareIndex: shareIndex,
    voteCommitmentTreePosition: confirmation.voteCommitmentTreePosition,
    submitAt: submitAt
)
```

`payload` is the helper request body verbatim — do not decode, re-shape or re-encode it.

`VotingDelegationSubmission` and `VotingWireEncryptedShare` are now decoded from the crate's own
wire structs, so their byte fields are base64 `String`s rather than `[UInt8]`, `sighash` is gone
from the delegation submission (the vote chain derives the signing digest itself), and
`tx1Effects` is present. A host that base64-encoded these fields itself before putting them on the
wire must stop and send the strings as they arrive.

## The SDK-side migration state machine is removed — `migrationAdvanceStep` replaces it

The public 5-state `MigrationState` enum, `MigrationAttentionReason`, and
`migrationState(accountUUID:)` are removed (this was never in a released SDK, so there is no
deprecation period). The SDK no longer derives a state machine of its own on top of the engine at
all: `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:) async throws -> MigrationAdvance?` drives the upstream
engine's public `advance_migration` API (the return type wraps the step with an advisory outlook —
see "`migrationAdvanceStep` returns `MigrationAdvance`" below). The broadcast-first ordering and
prove step's kind are native to the pinned librustzcash revision (upstream PR #2871); its
`Reevaluate` and `Replan` results project onto the existing `.requiresAttention(id:)` case.
`nil` means no run is stored at all (nothing was ever committed for the account); a stored run's
`.step` answers `.requiresAttention(id:)`, `.prove(transactions:)`, `.broadcast(_:)`,
`.rebuild(id:)`, `.waiting`, or the terminal `.complete` — priority order attend > broadcast >
prove > rebuild, and a cancelled run also reports `.complete` rather than ever being driven
further.

Every `MigrationState` case a host rendered UI off has a direct replacement — table below — but note
the shape is different: `migrationAdvanceStep` answers "what does the run need next", not "what is
the run's overall status", so a host that switched over the old 5 cases now reads several signals
together instead of one:

| Old `MigrationState` case | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `.notStarted` | `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:) == nil && migrationProgress(accountUUID:) == nil` |
| `.splitPendingConfirmation` | `!migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:).isPreparationPhaseComplete` |
| `.inProgress(progress)` | `migrationAdvanceStep` is `.prove`/`.broadcast`/`.waiting` + `migrationProgress(accountUUID:)` for the progress payload |
| `.requiresAttention(.invalidTransfer)` | `migrationAdvanceStep` is `.requiresAttention(id:)` (the engine surfaces it FIRST, ahead of any actionable step); the per-row detail is the new `.invalid(reason:)` case of `MigrationTransactionStatus.State` (`fundingSpent` / `rejectedInvalid` / `rejectedExpired`, with `blockedOn == .invalid`), and `hasInvalidMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` remains the boolean check |
| `.requiresAttention(.transferExpired)` | `migrationAdvanceStep` is `.rebuild(id:)` (an already-expired PREPARATION instead reports the new `.expired` case of `MigrationTransactionStatus.Blocker` in `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)` — its remedy is `restartCurrentMigrationStep(accountUUID:)`, not a rebuild) |
| `.complete` | `migrationAdvanceStep == .complete` (per-run, including a cancelled run — see below) |

`.complete` is **per-run, never "nothing left to migrate"**: whether a migratable balance remains
(several successive runs, or funds received later) is answered by
`proposeMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` alone — an empty schedule means no. This was already true
of the removed `MigrationState.complete` and carries over unchanged to `migrationAdvanceStep ==
.complete`.

Discharging each step:

- `.requiresAttention(id:)` → a transaction of the run is `.invalid(reason:)` (its funding note was
  spent outside the migration, or the network rejected its broadcast) and no automatic step can
  advance the run right now: SYNC and call `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` again, which
  adjudicates against the newly scanned data and re-offers the work where the obstruction was
  transient. Only if attention persists, surface the attention UX over the invalid
  `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)` row(s) and then `restartCurrentMigrationStep(accountUUID:)`
  (cancel and re-plan). Invalid rows are excluded from delivery and from the sync gate — a dead
  transfer is never served and gates nothing.
- `.broadcast(_:)` → `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)`, passing the case's own
  payload — submit and end the session (a broadcast session must not sync).
- `.prove(transactions:)` → the WHOLE provable batch is ready, and the batch IS the instruction:
  `proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)` at a sync wake-up (see
  `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)`). Its return names the PREPARATIONS it proved; submit each
  one yourself (see "A proved preparation is yours to submit" below). A `.transfer(crossing:)`
  entry's broadcast follows in its own LATER session (proving has no deadline of its own — a
  missed wake-up defers the proof, never invalidates it).

  ```swift
  // Before
  case let .prove(id, kind): ...
  // After
  case let .prove(transactions): ...  // transactions.first carries what the old single step did
  ```
- `.rebuild(id:)` → `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` (needs spend authority — a
  spending key in-process, or the external-signer re-serve ceremony for `usk: nil`).
- `.waiting` → nothing is actionable now: register OS wake-ups at the heights
  `migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)` returns, plus each `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)`
  row's `scheduledHeight` for the broadcast windows.

## The app has no semantic goal: the conduit, the executors, and reads

`finalizeReadyMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` and
`executeNextPendingMigrationTransfer(accountUUID:options:useEstimatedTip:)` are **removed**, along
with the `MigrationTransferAttempt` enum. Neither shipped in a release, so there is no deprecation
period. The ruling behind the removal, verbatim:

> "`executeNextPendingTransfer` is *also* wrong, yes. The app should have no semantic goal except
> to advance the migration and perform the advancement's dictates."

Both were kind-filtered drives wearing semantic names. `finalizeReadyMigrationTransfers` looped the
advance and executed only `.prove`, stopping on anything else; `executeNextPendingMigrationTransfer`
cranked once, executed only `.broadcast`, and re-interpreted every other step as an outcome of its
own. A driver that cranks the conduit and switches over the step sees all of that directly — and
more precisely, since `.nothingDue` collapsed six distinct situations into one word.

The migration ACTION surface is now exactly three things: the CONDUIT
(`migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)`), the INSTRUCTION EXECUTORS
(`proveMigrationTransactions`, `performMigrationBroadcast`, `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers`), and
READS — plus `takeMigrationPreparation(accountUUID:byTxid:)`, which is not a fourth executor but
the retrieval half of the prove executor's own return (see below).

### The replacement: drive it yourself

```swift
// Before — two semantic entry points, each with its own idea of what the migration needs
let proved = try await synchronizer.finalizeReadyMigrationTransfers(accountUUID: account)
switch try await synchronizer.executeNextPendingMigrationTransfer(
    accountUUID: account,
    options: options,
    useEstimatedTip: true
) {
case .nothingDue:            break
case .awaitingProof(let id): showAwaitingProof(id)
case .executed(let result):  handle(result)
}

// After — crank, then perform the crank's dictate with the crank's own payload
switch try await synchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID: account)?.step {
case .prove(let instruction):
    let outcome = try await synchronizer.proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID: account, instruction, maxProofs: 4)
    for txid in outcome.preparationTxids {
        let prepared = try await synchronizer.takeMigrationPreparation(accountUUID: account, byTxid: txid)
        // Ordinary raw-transaction submission — whatever the app already uses — then the app's own
        // record path, then the engine's mark, which takes the retrieval result straight back.
        let submission = await submitRawTransaction(prepared.pczt)
        record(submission, for: prepared.id)
        if case let .accepted(txId) = submission {
            try await synchronizer.recordMigrationPreparationBroadcast(
                accountUUID: account,
                prepared,
                result: .success(txId: txId)
            )
        }
    }
case .broadcast(let instruction):
    let result = try await synchronizer.performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID: account, instruction, options: options)
    handle(result)
case .rebuild:
    _ = try await synchronizer.refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID: account, usk: usk)
case .requiresAttention(let id):
    showAttention(id)
case .waiting, .complete, .none:
    break
}
```

Mapping the removed outcomes:

| Removed | Now |
| --- | --- |
| `finalizeReadyMigrationTransfers`'s loop | the driver's own: crank, prove, crank again. Proving can unblock rows the batch did not name, so re-cranking is how you drain a run — and unlike the sweep, a driver that sees a now-due `.broadcast` can deliver it instead of merely stopping. |
| `.nothingDue` | whichever step the crank actually returned. Six distinct situations reported the same word: `.waiting`, `.complete`, `.requiresAttention(id:)`, `.rebuild(id:)`, `nil` (no stored run), and a `.prove` batch with no `isScheduleDue` member (opportunistic proving work — the lane had nothing to *deliver*, but the run had plenty to do). |
| `.awaitingProof(id:)` | a `.prove` step containing a target whose `isScheduleDue` is `true`. Same information, from the step itself. |
| `.executed(result)` | `performMigrationBroadcast`'s return value, a bare `MigrationTransferResult`. With an instruction in hand there is no empty outcome to distinguish it from. |

`proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)` takes a **proof budget** the removed sweep
never offered: each proof is seconds of CPU, so a background session bounds what it takes on and
cranks again next time. It must be at least `1`; a lower value throws
`rustMigrationProveTransactions` rather than silently proving nothing. Skips (a row already proved,
or one whose anchor the wallet cannot resolve yet) do not spend the budget.

### A proved preparation is yours to submit, the ordinary way

`proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)` no longer returns a bare `Int`. It returns
`MigrationProveOutcome` — `totalProved` plus `preparationTxids`. **Breaking, with no deprecation
period** (nothing here has shipped in a release): a caller that used the count reads
`outcome.totalProved`.

The ruling behind the new shape, verbatim in substance:

> A proved preparation is a complete PCZT (signatures + proofs); its submission is the ORDINARY
> path, not the engine's delivery ceremony — preparations are ZIP 318-exempt, and the engine's own
> contract is that a preparation is broadcast as soon as it is proved.

Four clauses follow from it, and the surface implements exactly them:

1. **The prove return lists the preparations it proved, and only those.** A transfer's txid is
   never returned, because appearing in that list means "retrievable" — and a transfer is served
   by the drive's `.broadcast` instruction alone. A driver therefore makes **no kind judgment of
   its own**: the return carries it.
2. **The accessor IS the take seam.** `takeMigrationPreparation(accountUUID:byTxid:)` resolves
   `txid -> row -> the store's atomic broadcast seam` in ONE database transaction: the wallet's
   own record of the transaction binds AT RETRIEVAL, not after submission. It is not a byte read.
   It is idempotent — a consumer that crashed between retrieving and submitting re-retrieves
   exactly the same bytes over the same record — so retrieve **at submission time**, not eagerly.
3. **It is preparation-gated.** A transfer's txid is refused with
   `rustMigrationTakePreparation`, whose message states that transfers are served by the drive's
   broadcast instruction alone. An unknown txid, and a preparation whose proof is not persisted,
   are refused the same way; the latter is the readiness gate, discharged by proving again.
4. **The DTO carries the engine transfer id**, alongside the finalized transaction bytes and the
   row's stored txid, so the app records the submission's outcome through its standard record path
   with no identity of its own to keep.

Then **close the loop** with `recordMigrationPreparationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:result:)`. The
accessor bound the WALLET's record at retrieval, but the ENGINE's own per-row `Proved -> Broadcast`
mark is what `performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)` makes on its success arm — and a
preparation the app submitted never travels that path. This member is that same mark, made by the
app at the same moment. It takes the `PreparedMigrationTransfer` the accessor returned (possession
of the retrieval result is what says you hold the submission you are reporting on), is
preparation-gated in the same register (a transfer's id is refused; that lane records itself), and
is for **acceptances** — a non-acceptance needs no call, because the engine's network-error outcome
records nothing by design and leaves the row exactly as re-servable as silence would.

Retrieved-but-never-submitted is a bounded, engine-modelled state, not a leak: the record is
idempotent, the preparation carries a ZIP 203 expiry, and an unsubmitted row surfaces through the
ordinary attention path once it expires. Submitted-but-never-marked is bounded too — and with the
mark in place it is now the ACCIDENT, not the ordinary path: an app that crashed between submitting
and marking still converges, because the engine promotes any in-flight transaction its scan sees
mine (by the id it stored when it BUILT the transaction) and a later re-serve of the same bytes
draws a duplicate rejection the SDK records as success.

The bytes are a FINALIZED CONSENSUS TRANSACTION, submittable as-is — no extraction step, no
`MigrationNetworkPrivacyOptions`, no broadcast session. Do not build a parallel submit path for
them: use the raw-transaction machinery the app already has.

`performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)` has **no `useEstimatedTip`**. That parameter
existed because the delivery lane advanced internally; the conduit always projects the wall-clock
estimate, so the acceleration is applied once, at the crank. (`hasOverdueMigrationTransfers` keeps
its `useEstimatedTip` — it is a read, not a lane.)

### Instructions are opaque: the executors cannot be called un-instructed

Continuing the ruling:

> "And as such it should be provided with no *capabilities* for such semantic goals."

`MigrationAdvanceStep.broadcast` carries a new `MigrationBroadcastInstruction` instead of a bare
`UInt32` id, and **neither `MigrationBroadcastInstruction` nor `MigrationProveTarget` has a public
initializer**. The advance marshaling is their only producer, so the only way to hold an instruction
is to have cranked `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` — holding one *is* the proof that you did.
Un-instructed proving or broadcasting no longer compiles.

Source-compatibility consequences for a host:

- `case .broadcast(let id)` where `id` was a `UInt32` becomes
  `case .broadcast(let instruction)`; read `instruction.id` where you need the id for display,
  logging, or correlating with a `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)` row.
- Code that CONSTRUCTED a `MigrationProveTarget` (only test fixtures could have — the SDK never
  asked for one) no longer compiles. There is no replacement, by design; drive a real crank
  instead, or stub at your own seam. This mirrors `AccountUUID`, which has been construction-free
  since it shipped.

This is a **Swift-surface property, not a security boundary**. At the C ABI everything is forgeable,
and the Rust executors' per-row state gating — a non-`Proved` row is refused, a row not awaiting its
proof is skipped — remains the actual safety backstop, not the authority model. The instruction type
makes the correct call shape the only one that compiles; it does not make the incorrect one
impossible.

One behavioral consequence worth planning for: a **stale instruction throws**. The removed delivery
call re-advanced inside its single-flight guard, so a concurrent or replayed call reported
`.nothingDue`. `performMigrationBroadcast` cannot — it has an instruction, not a question — so the
broadcast seam's staleness refusal surfaces as
`ZcashError.rustMigrationTakeBroadcastTransaction`. Discharge it by cranking
`migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` again, not by retrying the executor. Single-flight itself is
unchanged: concurrent broadcasts on one account (including a `submitNoteSplit` racing a
`performMigrationBroadcast`) still serialize rather than throw on contention, and the privacy-gate
marking and record-after-submit ordering are byte-for-byte what they were.

The ceremony/consent lane is deliberately untouched: `prepareNoteSplit` / `submitNoteSplit` and the
propose/sign/store family are PRE-drive consent flows — a user approving a plan that does not exist
yet — so there is no instruction for them to carry.

### Removed: `rescheduleOverdueMigrationTransfer` / `pendingMigrationTransferProposal`

Both the pre-release name and the rename are gone, before ever shipping in a release, along with
error code `rustMigrationPendingTransferProposal` (ZRUST0123). A kind-filtered peek at the queue
("the next TRANSFER, specifically") is a malformed question under the advance design: any answer
either masks imminent work of another kind or contradicts what the drive would serve. Take the
scheduling answer from `migrationAdvanceStep`'s outlook — which names the next serviceable work of
ANY kind — and the display answer from `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:)` plus the
committed `MigrationSchedule` you already hold. Drop the call.

### Signing-session counts are precomputed by the engine, not derived in Swift

`MigrationRunEstimate.Run.signingSessions(maxTransactionsPerSession:)` and
`MigrationRunEstimate.totalSigningSessions(maxTransactionsPerSession:)` are removed. They computed
`ceil(transactions / maxTransactionsPerSession)`, which UNDERCOUNTS the real signing workload:
external-signer effort is actions, not a transaction count (a preparation transaction weighs 16
Orchard-family actions, a transfer 3), so — for example — 6 preparations plus 1 transfer is 99
actions, one Keystone round over the 96-action budget, needing 2 rounds, while any count-based
ceiling admitting ≥ 7 transactions per session claimed 1.

Replacement: `MigrationRunEstimate.Run` gains `actions: Int` (the signing workload) and
`keystoneSigningSessions: Int` (the number of Keystone signing ROUNDS the upstream engine's own
optimal `MinRounds` packing computes for the run, under the new `MigrationSigningBudget.keystone`
== 96 budget), and `MigrationRunEstimate` gains the cross-run sums `totalActions`/
`totalKeystoneSigningSessions`. Both are read-only, verbatim engine passthrough — there is no
Swift-side computation to call with a different budget; for an actual PCZT batch (any budget, order
preserved) use the new `Synchronizer.batchMigrationPcztsForSigning(_:maxActionsPerSession:)`
instead.

### Model initializer changes

- `MigrationTransactionStatus.init(...)` gains two required parameters: `dependsOn: [UInt32]` (the
  ids of the same run's transactions that must mine before this one can be built or broadcast; empty
  when it depends on nothing) and `anchorBoundaryHeight: BlockHeight?` (the bucketed boundary a
  TRANSFER's anchor was drawn against; always `nil` for a preparation, which anchors near-tip at
  proving time instead of a drawn boundary). A new `Array<MigrationTransactionStatus>.isPreparationPhaseComplete`
  computed property answers `.splitPendingConfirmation`'s replacement above.
- `MigrationUnsignedTransferPczt.init(...)` gains a required `actions: Int` (the signer action
  weight for budget batching — 16 for a preparation, 3 for a transfer; `0` on the signed
  counterparts `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:)` reconstructs, which carry no
  stored kind to weigh).
- `MigrationSchedule.init(...)` gains a required `preparations: [MigrationPreparationStep]` (the
  note-preparation transactions of the same plan — the transfer rows alone do not surface the
  preparations that mint their funding notes). `Codable` decode is back-compatible: a copy persisted
  before this field existed decodes it as an empty array.
- `MigrationSchedule`'s `encode(to:)` deliberately OMITS `proposalHandle`: the handle identifies a
  process-lifetime native plan cache entry, so no persisted copy could ever identify a live plan —
  every decoded copy (round-tripped or legacy) therefore carries handle `0`, the documented
  "re-propose instead of committing a persisted schedule" contract, by construction.
- `MigrationTransactionStatus.State` gains `.invalid(reason: MigrationInvalidReason)` (with
  `MigrationInvalidReason.fundingSpent` / `.rejectedInvalid` / `.rejectedExpired`) and
  `MigrationTransactionStatus.Blocker` gains `.invalid`: the engine's event-recorded death states
  (a foreign spend of a funding note, or a terminal network rejection). Chain inclusion outranks
  the mark — a row the wallet's scan has observed mined reports `.mined`, never `.invalid`. An
  exhaustive `switch` over either enum stops compiling until the new case is handled.

### New members

`proveMigrationTransactions(accountUUID:_:maxProofs:)`,
`performMigrationBroadcast(accountUUID:_:options:)`,
`migrationSyncWakeups(accountUUID:)`, `estimatedMigrationChainTip()`,
`estimatedMigrationSecondsPerBlock()`,
`batchMigrationPcztsForSigning(_:maxActionsPerSession:)`, and `hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:useEstimatedTip:)`
(the pre-existing `hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:)` becomes a convenience overload
defaulting `useEstimatedTip` to `false`). The two `estimated*` members take NO account: the
projection reads the wallet-shared blocks table, so — like the batching group — one answer serves
every account (an earlier unreleased iteration carried an unused `accountUUID:`; drop the argument).
See each member's doc comment for its full contract; the estimated-tip and sync-gate notes below
cover the cross-cutting parts.

There is no repair entry point at all, and nothing to call to get one. Every repair the SDK once
exposed is now the engine's, performed on every `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)`: a funding
note spent outside the migration is discovered by the satisfiability oracle from scanned wallet
data; a recorded broadcast is promoted to mined; and a transaction this process submitted whose
broadcast was never recorded — a crash, or a failed persist, between submitting and recording — is
recognized by the id the engine derived when it BUILT it, and promoted just the same. An earlier
unreleased iteration exposed that last one as `reconcileUnrecordedMigrationBroadcasts(accountUUID:)`
(and before that, `reconcileMigrationInvalidations(accountUUID:)`); delete the call.

### `useEstimatedTip`

`hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:useEstimatedTip:)` gains a `useEstimatedTip: Bool`
parameter (a protocol-extension overload without it defaults to `false`, so existing one-argument
call sites keep compiling unchanged). `true` opts the due-ness check into the wall-clock chain-tip
estimate `estimatedMigrationChainTip()` projects from the most recently scanned blocks'
header times: the estimate may only ACCELERATE scheduled-height due-ness (the effective tip is
`max(scanned, estimated)`) and expiry is always evaluated against the SCANNED tip, never the
estimate — so a wallet that wakes between syncs can deliver an already-due transfer without first
paying for a sync, and an estimator failure silently degrades to the scanned-tip behavior rather
than blocking or crashing the call.

The same rule applies to `migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)`, which needs no parameter for it: the
conduit ALWAYS projects and passes the estimate. That is the only place the acceleration enters
now — the instruction executors judge nothing, so they take no tip.

### The sync gate is behavior-based: one condition, no timer

`isMigrationSyncBlocked()`/`migrationSyncBlockedStream` block sync for exactly ONE reason now, and
it is present-tense: **a migration submission is in flight** — the transaction has reached the
network but its outcome is not recorded yet. Ordinarily that is a matter of seconds. The
120 s self-expiring marker behind it is (re-)armed at the last pre-submit instant, after the Tor
bootstrap, so a slow bootstrap does not burn its window; its deadline is a CRASH-RECOVERY ceiling
(a crash between submit and record must not wedge sync forever), not a privacy interval, and a
marker observed implausibly far in the future (a backwards clock step) is clamped/ignored rather
than wedging sync.

Two conditions that blocked sync earlier in this pre-release window are gone.

**The post-broadcast privacy buffer is REMOVED**, along with
`Synchronizer.migrationPrivacySyncBufferDuration` (both the protocol requirement and its
protocol-extension default) — delete any reference; nothing replaces the property, because there
is no duration left to report. The buffer paused sync for a fixed window after each broadcast so
the broadcast would not be correlated with a fresh sync. That reasoning was backwards: a fixed
delay is itself a correlation SIGNATURE — broadcast at T, sync reliably at T + delay, repeated
across every broadcast of a migration that runs for days — so time-based spacing was the wrong
abstraction, not an insufficient dose of the right one. It is not lengthened or randomized; it is
deleted. What replaces it is behavioral and belongs to the host: a wake serves the drive's
instruction and does not auto-append a sync, so a sync session starts for a REASON (the outlook
naming sync-bound work, an organic scheduled sync, or the user). User intent that requires sync — a
manual balance refresh, an attempt to create a transaction — is never held; the seconds-scale
in-flight marker is the only wait, and only because a submission is genuinely mid-flight. A gate
file persisted by an earlier build still carries the buffer's `resumeAt` field; it is read
gracefully and ignored, so an in-flight marker beside it survives the upgrade and a stale buffer
never blocks a post-upgrade launch.

**A READY-broadcast clause is REMOVED** (danny + nuttycom, 2026-08-05) — it blocked sync whenever a
proved, schedule-due transfer was servable, and was field-implicated in a live wedge where it
blocked the very sync whose scanned progress the pending broadcast needed. The probe it consulted
had no consumer left afterwards and has since been removed from the FFI and the welding entirely.
No gate path consults any work-pending query.
`hasOverdueMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:useEstimatedTip:)` remains available, but purely as an
informational one (re-arm background execution, launch reconciliation) — it deliberately counts
due-but-unproved `Signed` rows too, whose proofs are produced AT sync wake-ups, so gating sync on
it would starve the very work that clears it.

The broadcast-or-sync session split itself is unaffected: an app open whose next step is a
broadcast runs a no-sync delivery session, which is a statement about THAT session, not a hold on
sync in general.

## `migrationAdvanceStep` returns `MigrationAdvance`, wrapping the step with an advisory outlook

`migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID:)` (and the welding pair) now returns `MigrationAdvance?`
instead of `MigrationAdvanceStep?`: the same step, plus the engine's advisory OUTLOOK
(librustzcash #2936) — `next: MigrationNextWork?`, naming the kind of the migration's next
serviceable work and the earliest target height it becomes serviceable at, assuming the returned
step is executed (`nil` means nothing height-schedulable: what follows is chain-driven,
user-driven, or the migration is terminal).

```swift
// Before
let step = try await synchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID: accountUUID)
switch step {
case .prove(let transactions): ...
case .broadcast(let instruction): ...
...
}

// After
let advance = try await synchronizer.migrationAdvanceStep(accountUUID: accountUUID)
switch advance?.step {
case .prove(let transactions): ...
case .broadcast(let instruction): ...
...
}
// `advance?.next`, when present, says what session to plan for once `.step` is executed -- a
// `.broadcast` outlook needs no sync, a `.prove` one is sync-bound. `migrationSyncWakeups`
// remains the proving-schedule authority; the outlook is one call's lookahead only.
```

Existing call sites that only pattern-matched the step's cases now unwrap `.step` first (or switch
over `advance?.step` directly, as above); the outlook is additive and safe to ignore.

## The pool-migration surface rides the final engine

The Orchard→Ironwood migration group (never in a released SDK) is rewired onto the final engine
crates (`zcash_pool_migration` and `zcash_client_sqlite`'s pool-migration store). For integrators
tracking the unreleased surface:

- **The external-signer note-split pair went plural.** The engine builds N preparation
  transactions, not one split transaction, so
  `createUnsignedNoteSplitPCZT(accountUUID:) -> Data` is now
  `createUnsignedNoteSplitPCZTs(accountUUID:for:) -> [MigrationUnsignedTransferPczt]` (it also
  creates the run, persisted unsigned -- `schedule`, from `proposeMigrationTransfers`, identifies
  the cached plan to build from by its opaque `proposalHandle` when this call is the one creating
  the run; a stored non-terminal run resumes handle-free), and
  `storeSignedNoteSplitPCZT(accountUUID:_: Data)` is now
  `storeSignedNoteSplitPCZTs(accountUUID:_: [MigrationSignedTransferPczt])` (all-or-nothing; the
  returned `PreparedMigrationTransfer` is a storage receipt whose `pczt` really is a PCZT and whose
  `txid` is zeroed — the broadcastable value is served by the delivery lane). One signing ceremony still covers the whole
  migration together with `createUnsignedMigrationTransferPCZTs`.
- **`MigrationState.complete` is PER-RUN.** It means "the stored run is fully mined", never
  "nothing left to migrate": ask `proposeMigrationTransfers` whether anything remains (an empty
  schedule means no), and only then treat the account as done. Sequential runs are first-class — a
  new commit over a completed run starts the next one.
- **`MigrationState.readyToPropose` and `MigrationAttentionReason.syncRequiredBeforeNext` are
  removed** (not merely unreachable): the note split and the schedule commit atomically, so
  neither case ever had a real value to carry. This is source-breaking for an exhaustive `switch`
  over either enum — drop the corresponding `case`.
- **`includeResidual` is removed** from `proposeMigrationTransfers`, `restartCurrentMigrationStep`,
  and `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers`: the engine plans canonically and ZIP 318 keeps the residual
  in Orchard, so the parameter never had a real choice behind it. **`isSyncRequiredBeforeNextMigrationTransfer`
  is removed entirely** for the same reason: the note split and the schedule commit atomically, so
  a sync-required gate before the next transfer never had a use.
- **`refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` really rebuilds expired transfers.** It
  rebuilds every EXPIRED transfer of the stored run in place: each rebuilt transfer re-spends the
  SAME funding note (recovered by nullifier identity, never an equal-value substitute) on a fresh
  schedule — a fresh memoryless delay from the current tip, a fresh canonical expiry, and a
  freshly drawn boundary anchor — and returns the run's full `MigrationSchedule` as stored AFTER
  the refresh (the current stored schedule when nothing had expired; empty when no run is stored
  or the run is terminal), persisted ALL-OR-NOTHING: a mid-refresh failure persists NONE of the
  batch's rebuilds, so a successful return's schedule is exactly what was atomically committed,
  never a partial batch. The rebuilt rows' fresh scheduled/expiry heights exist nowhere but in
  that returned schedule — re-display it and use it for every later consent echo; a pre-refresh
  copy fails the verified echo with `migrationPlanStale` from then on. `usk` is now
  `UnifiedSpendingKey?`: pass a spending key to sign each rebuilt transfer anew in-process, or
  `nil` for the external-signer (Keystone) lane, which leaves the rebuilt transfers awaiting their
  signature so the existing `createUnsignedMigrationTransferPCZTs` / `storeSignedMigrationSchedulePCZTs`
  ceremony re-serves and completes them. A `FundingNoteUnavailable`-class failure (the expired
  transfer's exact funding note was spent outside the migration) throws naming
  `restartCurrentMigrationStep` (cancel and re-plan the remaining balance) as the remedy.
- **Two new errors:** `migrationPlanStale` (ZRUST0128 — the schedule/note-split consent echo no
  longer matches what is about to be signed; the echo is VERIFIED, never inert display data.
  Recovery depends on when it fires: BEFORE a run is committed, the mismatch is against the
  previewed plan — propose again and re-display. AFTER a run is committed, the mismatch is
  against the stored run itself, and re-proposing cannot converge (proposals re-randomize and
  never touch the committed run) — instead re-read the current stored schedule, which
  `refreshStaleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:usk:)` returns and the unsigned-transfer PCZT
  serve path works from, and re-display that) and `migrationProvingUnavailable` (ZRUST0127 —
  proving failed hard).
- **`MigrationTransferProposal.anchorHeight` is a reference height** (the proposal-time tip), not
  a commitment-tree anchor: ZIP 374 defers real anchors to proving time.

## The immediate migration lane leaves the engine

The immediate (single-transaction) Orchard→Ironwood migration is no longer proposed or tracked by
the migration engine's own schedule/commit machinery. It is now an ordinary send-max transfer that
the app executes through the normal transaction pipeline, with one new call to record the outcome:

- **`proposeImmediateMigration(accountUUID:) async throws -> MigrationSchedule` is now
  `proposeImmediateMigration(accountUUID:) async throws -> ImmediateMigrationProposal`.**
  `ImmediateMigrationProposal` carries an ordinary `Proposal` — feed it to
  `createProposedTransactions(proposal:spendingKey:)` (software accounts) or
  `createPCZTFromProposal(accountUUID:proposal:)` (Keystone accounts) exactly like any other
  transfer — plus the decoded `amount` (the net value crossing into Ironwood) and `fee`. There is
  no engine plan cache behind it: nothing about the returned proposal can go stale the way a
  `MigrationSchedule` preview can, and `signAndStoreMigrationSchedule` is not part of this lane (it
  remains for `proposeMigrationTransfers`'s gradual path).
- **New: `recordImmediateMigration(accountUUID:txid:) async throws`.** Call it after a successful
  broadcast (software or Keystone lane) so the platform migration state machine reports the sweep:
  `InProgress(0 of 1)` while unmined, then a quiet `NotStarted` once it mines. A MINED immediate
  sweep is CONSUMED — it is NOT surfaced as `Complete`, so there is nothing for the user to
  acknowledge and no per-run completion screen (the sweep zeroes the spendable Orchard balance, so
  the balance-gated "Migration Required" prompt does not re-offer unless new Orchard funds arrive
  later; an unmined sweep that expires likewise falls back to `NotStarted` so the prompt re-offers
  while funds remain). One row per account — a new record supersedes any previous one. Not
  broadcast-sensitive itself (no `migrationBroadcastDuringSync` guard): the actual broadcast already
  rides the guarded `createProposedTransactions`/`createTransactionFromPCZT` path.
- **`MigrationProgress` gains `isImmediate: Bool`** (additive — the public memberwise initializer
  defaults it to `false`, so existing `MigrationProgress(...)` construction sites keep compiling
  unchanged). It is `true` only while the immediate (send-max) lane's sweep is in progress and
  `false` for engine-tracked schedule runs, letting the app keep the immediate aftermath quiet (no
  per-transfer progress UI).
- **Removed** (internal welding surface, never reachable from outside the SDK):
  `ZcashRustBackendWelding.migrationProposeImmediateTransfers` and its FFI,
  `zcashlc_migration_propose_immediate_transfers`. Replaced by the general-purpose
  `proposeSendMaxTransfer(accountUUID:recipient:memo:orchardOnly:)` (called with `orchardOnly: true`
  and `recipient` set to the account's own address, `memo: nil`) — a plain "spend everything to one
  recipient" primitive the migration engine itself never touches.
- **`MigrationSchedule` itself is unaffected** and still backs `proposeMigrationTransfers` /
  `signAndStoreMigrationSchedule` (the gradual, privacy-path schedule).

## Residual locking and the run-count estimate join the migration group

The `Synchronizer` migration group gains three account-scoped requirements. Like the rest of the
group they come with protocol-extension defaults that throw an "unimplemented" `LocalizedError`, so
a custom `Synchronizer` conformer keeps compiling — but it must override them to offer the real
behavior (`SDKSynchronizer` does):

- **New: `lockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:) async throws -> Zatoshi`.** The "Lock balance" choice
  at migration `Complete`: locks every currently-spendable, not-already-locked legacy-Orchard note
  until explicit unlock and returns the total locked (`Zatoshi(0)` is legitimate — nothing was
  spendable). The lock never expires on its own; locked value leaves `PoolBalance.spendableValue`
  but stays in `PoolBalance.lockedValue` (and therefore in `total()`). Idempotent-additive:
  repeating the call locks (and reports) only notes that became spendable since. A concurrent-lock
  race throws (`rustMigrationLockResidual`, ZRUST0132) and may be retried.
- **New: `unlockMigrationResidual(accountUUID:) async throws -> Int`.** The release half: clears
  ALL of the account's output locks and returns the cleared count (safe — the SDK never creates
  proposal-scoped output locks). "Migrate anyway" over a locked residual composes as this call
  followed by `proposeImmediateMigration(accountUUID:)`; locked notes are excluded from note
  selection, so the unlock must come first.
- **New: `estimateMigrationRuns(accountUUID:) async throws -> MigrationRunEstimate`.** The rounds
  preview for the multi-round migration UI: how many migration RUNS ("rounds") migrating the whole
  spendable Orchard balance takes, per run both what it migrates and what preparing it costs, and
  the final residual that never migrates. External-signer session counts are a query on the result
  (`totalActions`/`totalKeystoneSigningSessions`), not a parameter. The zero-run estimate is a
  legitimate answer, not an error.
## `WalletInitMode` removed — `prepare()` derives the init flow

The `WalletInitMode` enum is gone. `prepare(with:walletBirthday:...)` no longer takes a
`for walletMode:` parameter — the SDK derives the flow itself:

- an account already exists in `data.db` → open the existing wallet;
- no account + a (past) birthday → **restore**: `recover_until` is set to the current chain tip, so
  the `[birthday … tip]` backfill is tracked as recovery (`SynchronizerState.isRecovering`);
- no account + `nil` birthday → **new wallet**: starts at a reorg-safe recent height, no recovery phase.

A deliberate re-scan is an explicit action — `rewind(_:)` — not an init mode. Update call sites:

```swift
// OLD:
try await synchronizer.prepare(with: seed, walletBirthday: birthday, for: .restoreWallet, ...)
// NEW:
try await synchronizer.prepare(with: seed, walletBirthday: birthday, ...)
```

## The live per-transaction migration status read joins the migration group

The `Synchronizer` migration group gains one account-scoped requirement. Like the rest of the
group it comes with a protocol-extension default that throws an "unimplemented" `LocalizedError`,
so a custom `Synchronizer` conformer keeps compiling — but it must override it to offer the real
behavior (`SDKSynchronizer` does):

- **New: `migrationTransactionStatuses(accountUUID:) async throws -> [MigrationTransactionStatus]`.**
  The live per-transaction detail view behind `migrationProgress(accountUUID:)`'s aggregate
  summary: every committed migration transaction's kind (preparation layer/index or transfer
  crossing), lifecycle state (`broadcast`/`mined` fold the engine's txid/mined-height payload into
  the matching case, so illegal combinations are unrepresentable — a MINED row's txid is NOT
  carried by the engine's own state model), scheduled/expiry heights, readiness, and next
  action/blocker, keyed by a stable id. A verbatim marshal of the engine's own
  `MigrationState::transaction_statuses`, mined-reconciled at read like every sibling; an empty
  array means no stored run or no transactions, not an error. New error code
  `rustMigrationTransactionStatuses` (ZRUST0135).

## The Keystone batch-signing bridge joins the migration group

The `Synchronizer` migration group gains four DB-free, account-free requirements — no
`accountUUID` parameter, since all four operate purely on caller-held PCZT bytes and a scanned
device response, never the wallet database or the migration engine. Like the rest of the group,
the three throwing members come with a protocol-extension default that throws an "unimplemented"
`LocalizedError`, so a custom `Synchronizer` conformer keeps compiling; the fourth
(`resetKeystoneSignBatchDecoder()`) is non-throwing and gets an inert no-op default instead
(mirroring `isMigrationSyncBlocked()`'s treatment). `SDKSynchronizer` overrides all four with real
behavior, forwarding straight to the rust backend rather than through the per-account migration
actor:

- **New: `buildKeystoneSignBatchQRParts(requestId:pczts:maxFragmentLen:) async throws -> [String]`.**
  Builds the animated multi-part QR frames for a Keystone batch-signing request covering `pczts`
  (preparation PCZTs first, then transfer PCZTs, in schedule order). Every PCZT is redacted for
  the batch-Signer role INSIDE this call before it reaches the wire — callers must NOT pre-redact,
  and must retain their own unredacted `pczts`: those bytes, in the SAME order, are what
  `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:)` applies the device's signatures onto.
- **New: `resetKeystoneSignBatchDecoder() async`.** Discards any in-flight multi-part scan
  session. Only one decode session exists at a time; call this on scan-screen entry, retry, and
  exit. Non-throwing and infallible.
- **New: `decodeKeystoneSignBatchPart(_:expectedRequestId:) async throws -> KeystoneBatchDecodeResult`.**
  Feeds one scanned QR frame to the active (or freshly started) decode session. Returns the new
  public `KeystoneBatchDecodeResult` model: `complete`/`progress` while more frames are needed;
  once complete, the signatures-only response bytes (no PCZT is echoed by the device) and, when
  the response envelope carried it, the new public `KeystoneFirmwareVersion` — the ONLY way to
  learn the signing device's firmware version in this batch flow, since the "signed" PCZTs are
  reconstructed from caller-held bytes plus signatures, never from device-returned PCZT bytes. A
  request-id mismatch at completion throws (a stale/unrelated scan).
- **New: `applyKeystoneBatchSignatures(pczts:batchSignResponse:) async throws -> [MigrationSignedTransferPczt]`.**
  Applies the ceremony's Keystone batch signatures to `pczts`, positionally — `pczts` MUST be the
  SAME array, in the SAME order (including the SAME unredacted bytes), passed to
  `buildKeystoneSignBatchQRParts(requestId:pczts:maxFragmentLen:)`. Returns one signed PCZT per
  element, ready for the existing `storeSignedNoteSplitPCZTs(accountUUID:_:)` /
  `storeSignedMigrationSchedulePCZTs(accountUUID:_:)` calls.

New error codes `rustMigrationKeystoneBuildSignBatchQrParts` (ZRUST0136),
`rustMigrationKeystoneDecodeSignBatchPart` (ZRUST0137), and
`rustMigrationKeystoneApplyBatchSignatures` (ZRUST0138). Like the rest of the migration group, the
Closure/Combine wrapper synchronizers do not mirror these four members.

## The debug fast-reschedule endpoint is removed

`debugRescheduleMigrationTransfers(accountUUID:) async throws -> Int` (DEBUG/QA only) and its error
code `rustMigrationDebugRescheduleTransfers` (ZRUST0139) are gone before ever shipping in a release.
Its purpose — rewriting a committed migration schedule's transfer heights so real broadcast delivery
could be exercised without waiting out ZIP 318's privacy delay — is superseded on the engine side by
compressed test-network scheduling at commit time. There is no replacement; drop the call.

## Custom (regtest-style) networks and `NetworkType.regtest`

`NetworkType` gained a third case, `regtest`. **This is a source-breaking change for exhaustive
`switch` statements over `NetworkType`** — add a `.regtest` arm (or a `default`) when updating.

Custom networks let the SDK talk to a custom-parameter chain (for example a modified-mainnet
Ironwood testing backend) whose network upgrades activate at arbitrary heights:

- `ZcashNetworkBuilder.regtest(activationHeights:)` builds a regtest-identity network with the given
  `NetworkActivationHeights` (a `nil` height means "not activated"; the heights are not validated —
  mirror the `nuparams` of the node/`lightwalletd` you connect to).
- `ZcashNetworkBuilder.custom(base:activationHeights:)` combines a chosen base identity (address
  encoding + expected `chainName`, e.g. `.mainnet` for a modified-mainnet backend) with custom
  heights. On-disk databases still use the `regtest`-slot name prefix, so a custom network never
  collides with a real mainnet/testnet wallet in the same container.
- Server validation relaxes for custom networks: `ValidateServerAction` and
  `evaluateBestOf(endpoints:...)` skip the chain-name and consensus-branch-ID checks (the server of a
  modified chain may identify with its base chain's name and a nonstandard branch id). The
  Sapling-activation-height check still applies.

**Process-global registration and ordering.** The custom network's parameters are registered with
the Rust core **once per process** (the first `Initializer` created with a custom network does this).
Anything that resolves the custom network id before that registration — e.g. a
`DerivationTool(networkType: .regtest)` created before any `Initializer` — fails with
"custom network (id 2) used before it was configured", and key validators return `false`. Create the
`Initializer` first, or call `ZcashRustBackend.setCustomNetwork` yourself at startup. Registering a
**different** custom network later in the same process is a configuration bug: the newest values win
process-globally while earlier instances keep their own per-instance state (checkpoint sources,
constants), so the two desynchronize — the registration call reports this (and asserts in debug).

## `Synchronizer` gained `proposeSendMax`

`Synchronizer`, `ClosureSynchronizer`, and `CombineSynchronizer` each gained a new required method,
`proposeSendMax(accountUUID:recipient:memo:mode:)`, alongside the existing `proposeTransfer`. It
proposes a transaction that spends the maximum amount available in the account — as much as the new
`MaxSpendMode` allows — to a single recipient. The proposal draws on shielded funds only (Sapling,
Orchard, Ironwood); transparent balance is never selected and must be shielded first (see
`proposeShielding`). Unlike `proposeTransfer`, no `amount` is passed; the fee is already accounted
for by the returned proposal. Any external conformer of these protocols must implement the new
method.

# Migrating from previous versions to v2.8.0-rc.1

## `prepare` now validates the seed against the existing wallet

If the wallet database already contains seed-derived account(s) and the seed passed to `prepare`
does not match them, `prepare` throws `ZcashError.initializerSeedMismatch` (`ZINIT0006`) instead of
silently opening the old wallet (which desynced the app's stored seed from the on-disk account).
Restoring a different wallet requires `wipe()` first. Wallets whose only accounts are imported
(hardware-wallet UFVKs) are exempt — there is no seed-derived account to compare.

## PendingDb is no longer used

PendingDb is no longer used. Wallet developers should take care about deleting
the database file since the SDK will no longer require it or any of the
information stored.

Failed transactions will be treated as "Expired-Unmined" instead. The SDK won't
track failures on its own. Wallet developers would have to account for those.

## The shielded voting API is back, with breaking changes

The shielded voting API was removed on 2.7.0-rc.1 and is restored here on the
Ironwood (NU6.3) stack. `VotingRustBackend`, the `Voting*` types and
`PirSnapshotResolver`/`PirSnapshotProbing`/`HTTPPirSnapshotProbe` are available
again, but the API is not the one that shipped before 2.7.0-rc.1: `zcash_voting`
absorbed orchestration the SDK used to drive step by step, and made the
intermediate steps private. Wallet developers upgrading from a pre-2.7.0-rc.1
version must make the changes below. Wallet developers coming from 2.7.0-rc.1,
where voting was absent, can adopt the API as documented.

### Voting hotkeys are no longer derived from the wallet seed

This is the change most likely to affect a shipped wallet.

A voting hotkey is now an app-owned random value. `generateHotkey` is a type
method that takes only a network, and returns a `VotingHotkey` carrying a
`storedSecret`, the `rawOrchardAddress` derived from it, and that address's
`addressIndex`:

```swift
let hotkey = try VotingRustBackend.generateHotkey(networkId: networkId)
// Persist hotkey.storedSecret. Nothing else in VotingHotkey needs storing.
```

**The application must persist `storedSecret`.** It cannot be re-derived from
the wallet seed, so restoring a wallet from its seed phrase does not restore the
ability to vote with a hotkey whose secret was lost, and any voting power already
delegated to that hotkey becomes unusable. The SDK does not store it for you.
Calling `generateHotkey` again produces an unrelated hotkey rather than
recovering the previous one.

Hotkeys derived from a wallet seed by an earlier SDK version do not carry over.
Every API that previously took a hotkey seed now takes the stored secret instead.

`VotingHotkey` no longer exposes `secretKey`, `publicKey` or `address`; upstream
dropped the public key, and the address is now the raw Orchard address bytes.

### Committing a vote is a single call

`buildVoteCommitment`, `signCastVote`, `buildSharePayloads` and `encryptShares`
are replaced by one `commitVote`, which builds the proof, signs the cast vote,
derives the helper-share payloads and persists the recovery state. It is
idempotent: calling it again for the same round, bundle and proposal returns the
persisted result rather than rebuilding the proof.

The encrypted shares it returns are the ciphertexts the vote proof commits to.
There is no longer a standalone share-encryption step, because shares encrypted
outside the commitment would not correspond to any vote.

### The voting network is chosen when the database is opened

`open` takes the network, and fixes it for the lifetime of the handle. The calls
that used to take a `networkId` of their own no longer do, so a round can no
longer be initialized — or a vote committed — against a network the handle
disagrees with.

```swift
// Before
try backend.open(path: dbPath)
try backend.initRound(roundId: roundId, networkId: networkId, snapshotHeight: h, ...)

// After
try backend.open(path: dbPath, networkId: networkId)
try backend.initRound(roundId: roundId, snapshotHeight: h, ...)
```

`initRound`, `commitVote` and `precomputeDelegationPir` drop their `networkId`
parameter, and `VotingDelegationKeyInputs` drops its `networkId` property — omit
it from the initializer call. `generateHotkey`, `generateDelegationInputs`,
`extractOrchardFvk` and `generateNoteWitnesses` are unaffected: the first three
are type methods with no handle, and the last one's `networkId` selects the
*wallet* database's consensus parameters, not the voting identity.

An unknown network id now throws from `open` rather than from each later call.
A custom (regtest) network takes its voting identity from the registered base
network, so a modified-mainnet chain votes with mainnet hotkeys and address
HRPs; `open` throws if `zcashlc_set_custom_network` has not run yet.

### Other API changes

- `decomposeWeight` is removed. It has no replacement: share construction is now
  entirely internal to the voting crate.
- `buildPczt` and `buildAndProveDelegation` take the hotkey stored secret in
  place of a raw hotkey address. `buildAndProveDelegation` additionally requires
  the sender FVK, seed fingerprint, account index and round name, which the
  voting crate now needs together in order to construct delegation keys.
- `markVoteSubmitted` requires the cast-vote transaction hash. A vote is recorded
  as submitted by persisting the transaction that carried it, so that a restarted
  wallet resumes polling for that transaction instead of rebuilding the vote.
- `recordShareDelegation` no longer accepts a nullifier. The voting crate derives
  it from the vote's recovery state, so a caller can no longer record a nullifier
  that disagrees with the share it belongs to.
- `storeCommitmentBundle` is replaced by `recordVcPosition`.
- `VotingBundleSetupResult` gained `droppedCount`, the number of notes the
  canonical bundling policy discarded. A non-zero value means the wallet holds
  voting notes that will not be voted with, which `eligibleWeight` alone does not
  reveal.
- `setupBundles` now rejects an empty note set instead of returning an empty
  bundle layout.
- Round identifiers must be 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters encoding a
  canonical Pallas field element. Shorter or non-canonical identifiers are
  rejected by `initRound`.
- Types that carry key material or note secrets — `VotingHotkey`,
  `VotingNoteInfo`, `VotingPczt` and `VotingDelegationKeyInputs` — now conform to
  `Undescribable`, so they render as `--redacted--` rather than exposing their
  contents through logging, string interpolation or reflection.

## `AccountBalance` gained an Ironwood pool

`AccountBalance` gains a public `ironwoodBalance` pool for the Ironwood (NU6.3) shielded protocol,
alongside `saplingBalance` and `orchardBalance`. Reading code keeps compiling, but any place that
enumerates the shielded pools by hand — totalling them, rendering a per-pool breakdown, deciding
whether a balance is fully shielded — needs to account for the third pool or it will silently
under-report once NU6.3 activates. The value stays zero until then.

`AccountBalance` and `PoolBalance` have no public initializer, so this cannot break construction in
your code; balances are only ever produced by the SDK.

## `Broadcaster` redesign (multi-server submission)

The `Broadcaster` API introduced in the 2.6.0-alpha tags has changed:

- Create APIs return `[CreatedTransaction]` (fields: `txId`, `raw` — non-optional, `expiryHeight`) instead of `[ZcashTransaction.Overview]`. The `.foundTransactions` event still emits overviews. A transaction created in a previous app session can be rebuilt for submission with `CreatedTransaction(overview:)`.
- `submit(_ rawTransaction: Data, to: LightWalletEndpoint)` is gone. Use:

```swift
let outcome = await synchronizer.broadcaster.submit(
    transaction: createdTransaction,
    to: endpoints           // [LightWalletEndpoint]; timing: defaults to SubmissionTiming.default
)
```

`submit` no longer throws — it returns a `TransactionSubmissionOutcome` (`accepted(by:)`, `rejected(code:message:)`, `unreachable`, `timedOut`, `notAttempted`, `cancelled`). Treat `timedOut` as pending: the transaction may still have been broadcast.

- Retry semantics: the endpoint list passed to `submit` is persisted as the transaction's retry plan. The SDK's background resubmission retries pending transactions through those endpoints (sequentially) instead of the synchronizer's default endpoint, and never auto-submits transactions created through `Broadcaster` that the app hasn't submitted yet. If the plan store cannot be read, background resubmission skips the affected transactions rather than falling back to the default endpoint. Transactions the store has no plan for at all — anything sent through `Synchronizer` rather than `Broadcaster`, including everything created before this release — keep the previous behaviour and are retried against the synchronizer's endpoint. Plans are kept until the transaction expires (so a chain reorg cannot detach a transaction from its recorded endpoints), and `Synchronizer.wipe()` deletes the plan database file.
- The retry plan is recorded before any network attempt and stays recorded when `submit` returns `.cancelled` or `.timedOut`: background resubmission may still broadcast the transaction later. Treat those outcomes as "outcome unknown", not as "not sent".
- `LightWalletEndpoint` now conforms to `Equatable`. If your app declared that conformance retroactively, remove your declaration.

## `Initializer.InitializationResult` gained `.seedNotRelevant`

`Initializer.InitializationResult` (returned by `Initializer.initialize` and `Synchronizer.prepare`) gained a new case, `.seedNotRelevant`, returned when the rust layer reports that the provided seed does not match the accounts already present in the wallet database. Any exhaustive `switch` over `InitializationResult` must add a case for it. `prepare`/`initialize` can now return `.seedNotRelevant` in situations where they previously returned `.success` over a mismatched database — handle it the same way you already handle `.seedRequired`.

## Unmined transactions past their expiry are reported as `.expired`

`ZcashTransaction.Overview.getState(for:)` now returns `.expired` for an unmined transaction whose
expiry height is non-zero and at or below the height you pass in, even when the wallet database's
`expired_unmined` flag has not been set. These transactions previously stayed `.pending`
indefinitely — most visibly sends that were unmined when the wallet migrated across a
consensus-rule change. Transactions with no expiry height (`0`) are unaffected and still report
`.pending` while unmined.

This is a behavioural change with no compile-time signal. Apps that key UI, retry, or bookkeeping off
`.pending` will now see those transactions move to `.expired`, which is the state they should already
have been in. Verify that your `.expired` handling is reachable and does something sensible; a
transaction can now arrive there without the database flag ever flipping.

## Already-accepted transactions no longer report a submit failure

`Synchronizer.createProposedTransactions` and `Synchronizer.createTransactionFromPCZT` emit
`TransactionSubmitResult.success` instead of `.submitFailure` when the submit RPC rejects a
transaction the server turns out to already hold. On a non-zero error code the SDK asks the same
lightwalletd whether the txid is in mempool or chain, and trusts that answer over the rejection.

Apps that surfaced every `.submitFailure` as a failed send will show fewer of them. If you matched on
specific error codes or message text to recognise "already in mempool" / "already in chain" yourself
(Zebra's `MempoolError::InMempool` and `AlreadyQueued`, zcashd's `RPC_VERIFY_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN`),
remove that special-casing — the SDK now resolves those cases before you see them.

## New wallets get a server-derived birthday

For `WalletInitMode.newWallet`, the birthday is taken from a lightwalletd tree state one reorg
horizon below the chain tip rather than from the bundled checkpoint, so first launch scans far less
history. `Initializer.walletBirthday` therefore reflects the server's tree state height, not a
checkpoint height, and the two will not agree. Apps that persist, display, or assert on the birthday
should read it back from the initializer after `prepare` instead of assuming a bundled checkpoint
value. If the server is unreachable the bundled checkpoint is still used.

# Migrating from previous versions to 0.20.0-beta
The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers.

`stateStream` publisher replaces notifications related to `SyncStatus` changes.
These notifications are replaced by `stateStream`:
- .synchronizerStarted
- .synchronizerProgressUpdated
- .synchronizerStatusWillUpdate
- .synchronizerSynced
- .synchronizerStopped
- .synchronizerDisconnected
- .synchronizerSyncing
- .synchronizerEnhancing
- .synchronizerFetching
- .synchronizerFailed

`eventStream` publisher replaces notifications related to transactions and other stuff.
These notifications are replaced by `eventStream`:
- .synchronizerMinedTransaction
- .synchronizerFoundTransactions
- .synchronizerStoredUTXOs
- .synchronizerConnectionStateChanged

`latestState` is also new property that can be used to get the latest SDK state in a synchronous way.
`SDKSynchronizer.status` is no longer public. To get `SyncStatus` either subscribe to `stateStream` 
or use `latestState`. 

# Migrating from previous versions to 0.18.x
Compact block cache no longer uses a sqlite database. The existing database
should be deleted. `Initializer` now takes an `fsBlockDbRootURL` which is a 
URL pointing to a RW directory in the filesystem that will be used to store
the cached blocks and the companion database managed internally by the SDK.

`Initializer` provides a convenience initializer that takes the an optional
URL to the `cacheDb` location to migrate the internal state of the 
`CompactBlockProcessor` and delete that database. 

````Swift
    convenience public init(
        cacheDbURL: URL?,
        fsBlockDbRoot: URL,
        dataDbURL: URL,
        pendingDbURL: URL,
        endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint,
        network: ZcashNetwork,
        spendParamsURL: URL,
        outputParamsURL: URL,
        viewingKeys: [UnifiedFullViewingKey],
        walletBirthday: BlockHeight,
        alias: String = "",
        loggerProxy: Logger? = nil
    )
````

We do not make any efforts to extract the cached blocks in the sqlite
`cacheDb` and storing them on disk. Although this might be the logical 
step to do, we think such migration as little to gain since a migration
function will be a "run once" function with many different scenarios to
consider and possibly very error prone. On the other hand, we rather delete
the `cacheDb` altogether and free up that space on the users' devices since
we have surveyed that the `cacheDb` as been growing exponentially taking up
many gigabyte of disk space. We forsee that many possible attempts to copy
information from one cache to another, would possibly fail 

Consuming block cache information for other purposes is discouraged. Users
must not make assumptions on its contents or rely on its contents in any way. 
Maintainers assume that this state is internal and won't consider further
uses other than the intended for the current development. If you consider
your application needs any other information than the ones available through
public APIs, please file the corresponding feature request.

# Migrating from 0.16.x-beta to 0.17.0-alpha.x

## Changes to Demo APP
The demo application now uses the SDKSynchronizer to create addresses and
shield funds.
`DerivationToolViewController` was removed. See `DerivationTool` unit tests
for sample code.
`GetAddressViewController` now derives transparent and sapling addresses
from Unified Address
`SendViewController` uses Unified Spending Key and type-safe `Memo`

## Changes To SDK
### `CompactBlockProcessor`
`public func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> UnifiedAddress?`
`public func getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> SaplingAddress?` derived from UA
`public func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> TransparentAddress?`
is derived from UA
`public func getTransparentBalance(accountIndex: Int) throws -> WalletBalance` now
fetches from account exclusively
`func refreshUTXOs(tAddress: TransparentAddress, startHeight: BlockHeight) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
uses `TransparentAddress`

### Initializer
Migration of DataDB and CacheDB are delegated to `librustzcash`

removed `public func getAddress(index account: Int = 0) -> String`


### Wallet Types
`UnifiedSpendingKey` to represent Unified Spending Keys. This is a binary
encoded not meant to be stored or backed up. This only serves the purpose
of letting clients use the least privilege keys at all times for every
operation.

### Synchronizer
`sendToAddress` and `shieldFunds` now take a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead
of the respective spending and transparent private keys.
`refreshUTXOs` uses `TransparentAddress`

### KeyDeriving protocol
Addresses should be obtained from the `Synchronizer` by using the `get_address` functions
Transparent and Sapling receivers should be obtained by extracting the receivers of a UA
````Swift
public extension UnifiedAddress {
    /// Extracts the sapling receiver from this UA if available
    /// - Returns: an `Optional<SaplingAddress>`
    func saplingReceiver() -> SaplingAddress? {
        try? DerivationTool.saplingReceiver(from: self)
    }

    /// Extracts the transparent receiver from this UA if available
    /// - Returns: an `Optional<TransparentAddress>`
    func transparentReceiver() -> TransparentAddress? {
        try? DerivationTool.transparentReceiver(from: self)
    }
````

**Removed**
`func deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys(seed: [UInt8], numberOfAccounts: Int) throws -> [UnifiedFullViewingKey]`
`func deriveViewingKey(spendingKey: SaplingExtendedSpendingKey) throws -> SaplingExtendedFullViewingKey`
`func deriveSpendingKeys(seed: [UInt8], numberOfAccounts: Int) throws -> [SaplingExtendedSpendingKey]`
`func deriveUnifiedAddress(from ufvk: UnifiedFullViewingKey) throws -> UnifiedAddress`
`func deriveTransparentAddress(seed: [UInt8], account: Int, index: Int) throws -> TransparentAddress`
`func deriveTransparentAccountPrivateKey(seed: [UInt8], account: Int) throws -> TransparentAccountPrivKey`
`func deriveTransparentAddressFromAccountPrivateKey(_ xprv: TransparentAccountPrivKey, index: Int) throws -> TransparentAddress`

**Added**
`static func saplingReceiver(from unifiedAddress: UnifiedAddress) throws -> SaplingAddress?`
`static func transparentReceiver(from unifiedAddress: UnifiedAddress) throws -> TransparentAddress?`
`static func receiverTypecodesFromUnifiedAddress(_ address: UnifiedAddress) throws -> [UnifiedAddress.ReceiverTypecodes]`
`func deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed: [UInt8], accountIndex: Int) throws -> UnifiedSpendingKey`
`public func deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from spendingKey: UnifiedSpendingKey) throws -> UnifiedFullViewingKey`

## Notes on Structured Concurrency

`CompactBlockProcessor` is now an Swift Actor. This makes it more robust and have its own
async environment.

SDK Clients will likely be affected by some `async` methods on `SDKSynchronizer`.

We recommend clients that don't support structured concurrency features, to work around this by  surrounding the these function calls either in @MainActor contexts either by marking callers as @MainActor or launching tasks on that actor with `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
